This is the source of my [relay computer blog](https://relaycomputer.co.uk) generated using Hugo.

## Development server

Bulma CSS styles are brought in on npm packages so a `npm install` will sort those out. You can then run `hugo server` for a dev server.

## Build

Run `hugo` to build the project. All the website artifacts will then be stored in the `public/` directory (which are then uploaded verbatim to my host).
