Needless to say that global pandemic got in the way a bit and hampered progress but I also, well, kind of fell out of love with my relay computer for a bit.
Like most of my hobbies I can blow ‘hot and cold’ but given I also set myself the challenge of closely detailing progress in a series of videos (all 16 of them) it was leaning me towards the ‘cold’ rather than the ‘hot’. Anyho, we’re here now and the computer finally has its clock and all card bays of the computer now have something in them.</description></item></channel></rss>
