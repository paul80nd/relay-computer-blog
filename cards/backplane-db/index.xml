Although it was certainly more authentic and in-keeping with my computer’s theme it was massively time consuming for me and was ultimately putting me off making progress on construction.
Another problem with my previous construction methods was creating monstrosities like this:
This is the ‘W’ backplane connector which connects five of the ‘W’ type cards together … and its as precarious as it looks and over time I’ve found the ribbon cable on the back of these backplanes are getting a bit temperamental. If left well alone they’re fine but any knocks or pokes and whole lines can become disconnected. To solve this I made my own PCB for the Y backplane removing the need for the ribbon cable:</description></item></channel></rss>
