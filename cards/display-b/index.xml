There’s three things worth covering (plus an additional minor mention) … let’s start with backplanes.
The computer is designed with four backplanes (W, X, Y and Z) each taking five cards. Each card of the computer is designed to fit in a specific backplane as each backplane offers a unique selection of busses and connections. Generally you can put a card designated for a given backplane in to any of the five backplane slots (position mainly being an aesthetic thing) however the W backplane is the notable exception having slots W1 - W2 - W1 - W2 - W1 taking two double cards (with W1 and W2 connectors) and one single card (W1 connectors).</description></item><item><title>More Laser Cut Parts</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2017/08/more-laser-cut-parts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2017 13:13:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2017/08/more-laser-cut-parts/</guid><description>I’ve nearly got the design for the memory cards done and ready to share but once that’s out the way it’ll be time to get on with some construction again. With that in mind I cracked out the credit cards and got buying more relays plus some other bits and bobs and whilst I was in a spending mood I decided it was high time to treat the computer to some more laser cut parts.</description></item><item><title>User Interface Construction: Instruction, Clock and Sequencer</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2016/03/user-interface-construction-instruction/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2016 22:38:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2016/03/user-interface-construction-instruction/</guid><description>Well, the good news is I’ve just passed a major milestone in constructing this relay computer … it can now perform a single instruction in full firing the various control lines as needed. The bad news … I’m rather behind in blogging about it so this will be the first of a couple of ‘catch up’ posts which will culminate in a video showing off the computer as it currently stands.</description></item><item><title>User Interface Design: Instruction, Clock and Sequencer</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2015/04/user-interface-design-instruction-clock/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Apr 2015 23:19:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2015/04/user-interface-design-instruction-clock/</guid><description>Over my last seven posts I’ve been slowly putting together the card designs so that the computer will be able to operate the MOV-8, ALU and SETAB instructions. The final step in this series is to update the designs for the two display cards along with the main switches to work with the new cards added recently.
Diving straight in here is the latest version of the Display A design:</description></item><item><title>User Interface: Display B Initial Design and Construction</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/07/user-interface-display-b-initial-design/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2014 10:05:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/07/user-interface-display-b-initial-design/</guid><description>In my last post I put together the beginnings of the first display card … named in a brilliant flash of nomenclature as display card A. This time I’m turning my attention to the second display card … named (can you guess) display card B.
Whereas display A is dual purpose allowing a user to view and initiate control signals the second display card is read-only and displays the primary state of the computer. Initially this ‘primary state’ comprises of the data bus contents, condition register status and ALU function code / operation. I also had a rectangular gap spare on the card that looked like it’d fit an ammeter so that also now forms part of the second display too.</description></item></channel></rss>
