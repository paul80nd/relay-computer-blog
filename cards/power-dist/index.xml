The current milestone I&amp;rsquo;m working towards is finishing off the Program Counter, Incrementer and Memory cards (which are all well under way now) so that I can load a simple program in to the computer and set it running without any further intervention.</description></item><item><title>W Backplane Construction &amp; Power Distribution</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2016/04/w-backplane-construction-power/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2016 21:07:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2016/04/w-backplane-construction-power/</guid><description>Before I can test the new decoder, sequencer and controller cards all working together with the rest of the computer I need to construct the &amp;lsquo;W&amp;rsquo; backplane which the new cards sit on. Generally this backplane is similar in design to the &amp;lsquo;Z&amp;rsquo; backplane that the ALU cards and A/D and B/C register cards sit on. However, whereas each card on the Z backplane has the exact same connectors the W backplane is slightly more complex as the sequencer and control units are spread over two cards each requiring a different set of connectors.</description></item></channel></rss>
