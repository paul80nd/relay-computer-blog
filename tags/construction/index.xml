Needless to say that global pandemic got in the way a bit and hampered progress but I also, well, kind of fell out of love with my relay computer for a bit.
Like most of my hobbies I can blow ‘hot and cold’ but given I also set myself the challenge of closely detailing progress in a series of videos (all 16 of them) it was leaning me towards the ‘cold’ rather than the ‘hot’. Anyho, we’re here now and the computer finally has its clock and all card bays of the computer now have something in them.</description></item><item><title>Back to Backplanes</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2022/11/back-to-backplanes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Nov 2022 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2022/11/back-to-backplanes/</guid><description>Quite a while ago I decided to give up on the tedious wire wrap technique for building my cards. Although it was certainly more authentic and in-keeping with my computer’s theme it was massively time consuming for me and was ultimately putting me off making progress on construction.
Another problem with my previous construction methods was creating monstrosities like this:
This is the ‘W’ backplane connector which connects five of the ‘W’ type cards together … and its as precarious as it looks and over time I’ve found the ribbon cable on the back of these backplanes are getting a bit temperamental. If left well alone they’re fine but any knocks or pokes and whole lines can become disconnected. To solve this I made my own PCB for the Y backplane removing the need for the ribbon cable:</description></item><item><title>Decoder Construction</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2020/01/decoder-construction/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2020 03:03:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2020/01/decoder-construction/</guid><description>In my last post I covered off the full design for the decoder card so all that remains is to get it soldered up and tested. As before I’ve put a video together which covers the highlights:
As you can see towards the end of the video that’s the basics of branching complete and finally my computer is capable of running more complicated programs that have loops and decision making points in them. As reaching this point has coincided nicely with the start of a new decade I’ll now pause construction for a moment whilst I create a series of ‘2020 update’ videos. In these videos I’ll cover off:</description></item><item><title>Controller Construction</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2019/12/controller-construction/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Dec 2019 03:03:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2019/12/controller-construction/</guid><description>In my last couple of posts I covered off the full design for the controller unit. As the PCBs have now arrived I can get on with soldering up the cards and giving them a test. As mentioned in my last post, although the controller supports all the instruction classes the computer will eventually use I’m only soldering up the ALU, GOTO, MOV8 and SETAB instructions for now.
Let’s start with the lower card and, as before, I’ve put together a video which covers the highlights:</description></item><item><title>Sequencer Construction</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2019/11/sequencer-construction/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2019 03:03:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2019/11/sequencer-construction/</guid><description>In my last couple of posts I covered off the full design for the sequencer unit.

Likewise, here’s a video covering the upper card construction which also includes giving the cards a test together and then testing the whole sequencer unit when placed in the computer:</description></item><item><title>Making a PCB</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2019/03/making-a-pcb/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2019 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2019/03/making-a-pcb/</guid><description>After years of using pad/prototyping boards to build my computer I’ve decided to switch things up a bit and have a go at making a custom PCB. The thinking is that it should save me loads of time soldering and wire wrapping which will come in handy as I’ll soon be constructing three fairly-identical register cards and my patience is notoriously short. That said though it probably makes sense that my first PCB should be something a bit simpler. As it happens I do need to construct the Y backplane (which the 5 ‘Y’ type cards connect in to) which is a much simpler design and therefore an excellent ‘first PCB’ candidate.</description></item><item><title>Auxiliary Control Construction</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2018/03/auxiliary-control-construction/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2018 22:07:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2018/03/auxiliary-control-construction/</guid><description>In my last three posts I covered the design of the auxiliary control unit which will ease entering and inspecting programs in the computer’s memory. With the design ‘in the bag’ it’s time to get constructing although this time we’re not starting with a blank card …
Currently the auxiliary card has the gating relays along the bottom which connect the primary switches to either the address or data bus as required. So far these gating relays have been operated manually but that’s about to change as I add the remaining auxiliary control circuitry which will operate the gating directly. Also on the card are the row of LEDs on the left, card connectors at the top and finally the primary switch connectors on the right. Again, all of these bits will be hooked up shortly as I add the control circuitry. First though let’s get the auxiliary clock built and here’s a reminder of the clock circuit:</description></item><item><title>Incrementer Construction (Part 2 of 2)</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2017/12/incrementer-construction-part-2-of-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2017 12:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2017/12/incrementer-construction-part-2-of-2/</guid><description>In my last post I covered the construction of the lower incrementer card which is effectively a 16-bit half adder. This time I’m going to cover constructing the upper card of the incrementer which is a 16-bit register that can hold on to the incremented value before pushing it back out to the address bus.
The backplane connectors and LEDs were soldered down in my last post but there’s plenty more soldering to do. First up I can add the relay sockets, wire wrap posts and card interconnect wrap posts:</description></item><item><title>Incrementer Construction (Part 1 of 2)</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2017/12/incrementer-construction-part-1-of-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2017 11:07:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2017/12/incrementer-construction-part-1-of-2/</guid><description>We’re getting nearer and nearer to a computer that can run though a program in memory rather than just a single instruction … we’ve got memory to hold the program and a program counter to point to the current instruction in memory. Now it’s time to construct the 16-bit incrementer which will be used to advance the program counter on to point at the next instruction.
As the incrementer is spread over two cards I’ll likewise spread the construction over two blog posts focussing this time on the lower card. Before that though I’ll get a head start and solder down the LEDs and backplane connectors for both cards:</description></item><item><title>Memory Construction (Part 2 of 2)</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2017/11/memory-construction-part-2-of-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Nov 2017 16:52:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2017/11/memory-construction-part-2-of-2/</guid><description>In my last post I made a start on the memory unit construction with the lower memory card. The lower card centres around the memory IC which runs at 5V. The upper memory card picks up the task of converting the data and address bus coming in from the rest of the computer (running at 12V) to the 5V needed by the memory IC.
The LEDs and backplane connectors were soldered down in my last post so we can jump straight to adding the card interconnects which pass the local address/data busses to the lower card:</description></item><item><title>Memory Construction (Part 1 of 2)</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2017/11/memory-construction-part-1-of-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2017 14:53:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2017/11/memory-construction-part-1-of-2/</guid><description>It’s time to make a start on the construction of the memory unit and as mentioned in my last post this one is a bit more complex than ‘boring old registers’ and so I’ll split it over two posts. Let’s dive in with the easy part - soldering down the LEDs and backplane connectors:
For the lower memory card there are 16 LEDs for the 16-bit address bus and 8 LEDs for the 8-bit data bus. Both of these busses are ’local’ to the memory unit and operate on +5V and ground as covered in my post on the memory unit design. Unfortunately I’ve messed up here a bit as I’ve merrily gone and soldered down the same LEDs I use on all the other cards … the 12V ones. Although these LEDs will work with 5V they won’t be as bright due to the internal resistor in each being rated for 12V operation. A bit of a silly mistake to make but it’s done and I’m not so upset by it that it’s worth changing them over … I only realised when I tested the card and noticed the LEDs weren’t as bright as usual (doh).</description></item><item><title>Program Counter Construction</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2017/11/program-counter-construction/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Nov 2017 10:25:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2017/11/program-counter-construction/</guid><description>In my last couple of posts I’ve been slightly distracted by some ‘miscellany’ but now I return to form and crack on with constructing the program counter. The program counter is effectively two 8bit registers bolted together and wired out slightly differently using the address bus rather than data bus. As usual I’ll start with soldering down the LEDs:
This should all be very familiar now and there’s nothing unusual about these LEDs compared to previous cards. I’m just about at the point now where I’ve ‘perfected’ the way of soldering and wiring these up after many iterations on previous cards. Next up is backplane connectors and relay sockets:</description></item><item><title>Miscellany Special: Backplane X, Cable Routing and Address Bus</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2017/11/miscellany-special-backplane-x-cable/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Nov 2017 10:47:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2017/11/miscellany-special-backplane-x-cable/</guid><description>Continuing on with the theme from my last post … here is another ‘miscellany special’ covering all the little ‘side jobs’ I’ve been doing on my relay computer alongside the primary work of constructing the Program Counter, Memory and Incrementer cards. There’s three things worth covering (plus an additional minor mention) … let’s start with backplanes.
The computer is designed with four backplanes (W, X, Y and Z) each taking five cards. Each card of the computer is designed to fit in a specific backplane as each backplane offers a unique selection of busses and connections. Generally you can put a card designated for a given backplane in to any of the five backplane slots (position mainly being an aesthetic thing) however the W backplane is the notable exception having slots W1 - W2 - W1 - W2 - W1 taking two double cards (with W1 and W2 connectors) and one single card (W1 connectors).</description></item><item><title>Miscellany Special: Power Distribution</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2017/10/miscellany-special-power-distribution/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2017 11:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2017/10/miscellany-special-power-distribution/</guid><description>Having somehow forgotten to take time off work I’m now playing ‘annual leave catch up’ which means lots of four day weeks but also, and more importantly for this blog, I’m getting time to crack on with construction of my relay computer. The current milestone I’m working towards is finishing off the Program Counter, Incrementer and Memory cards (which are all well under way now) so that I can load a simple program in to the computer and set it running without any further intervention.</description></item><item><title>More Laser Cut Parts</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2017/08/more-laser-cut-parts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2017 13:13:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2017/08/more-laser-cut-parts/</guid><description>I’ve nearly got the design for the memory cards done and ready to share but once that’s out the way it’ll be time to get on with some construction again. With that in mind I cracked out the credit cards and got buying more relays plus some other bits and bobs and whilst I was in a spending mood I decided it was high time to treat the computer to some more laser cut parts.</description></item><item><title>W Backplane Construction &amp; Power Distribution</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2016/04/w-backplane-construction-power/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2016 21:07:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2016/04/w-backplane-construction-power/</guid><description>Before I can test the new decoder, sequencer and controller cards all working together with the rest of the computer I need to construct the ‘W’ backplane which the new cards sit on. Generally this backplane is similar in design to the ‘Z’ backplane that the ALU cards and A/D and B/C register cards sit on. However, whereas each card on the Z backplane has the exact same connectors the W backplane is slightly more complex as the sequencer and control units are spread over two cards each requiring a different set of connectors. The upshot is that the backplane has three ‘W1’ card slots and two ‘W2’ card slots. A diagram explains it better:</description></item><item><title>User Interface Construction: Instruction, Clock and Sequencer</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2016/03/user-interface-construction-instruction/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2016 22:38:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2016/03/user-interface-construction-instruction/</guid><description>Well, the good news is I’ve just passed a major milestone in constructing this relay computer … it can now perform a single instruction in full firing the various control lines as needed. The bad news … I’m rather behind in blogging about it so this will be the first of a couple of ‘catch up’ posts which will culminate in a video showing off the computer as it currently stands.</description></item><item><title>Controller Construction: MOV-8, ALU and SETAB</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2016/01/controller-construction-mov-8-alu-and/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2016 23:23:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2016/01/controller-construction-mov-8-alu-and/</guid><description>So yea, it’s been a while since my last post … in fact it’s been just over six months. For some reason I decided I didn’t have enough to do in the evenings so had a crack at becoming an actuary. Needless to say I’ve been busy studying for my entry exams and so the computer took a back seat for a while. Exams are done for now though so the computer is back on and I’m back constructing to get the MOV8, ALU and SETAB instructions running.</description></item><item><title>Sequencer Construction: 8-cycle FSM</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2015/07/sequencer-construction-8-cycle-fsm/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2015 09:27:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2015/07/sequencer-construction-8-cycle-fsm/</guid><description>I’m just about at the half way mark now for getting the computer to operate the MOV8, ALU and SETAB instructions. The easier cards are out of the way now … time for the slightly more complex ones. In this post it’s the sequencer cards which will deal with the ‘when’ of instructions by sending out timing pulses which the upcoming control cards will then use to operate the various control lines of the computer at the right time.</description></item><item><title>Decoder Construction: MOV-8, ALU &amp; SETAB</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2015/06/decoder-construction-mov-8-alu-setab/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2015 21:43:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2015/06/decoder-construction-mov-8-alu-setab/</guid><description>In a change from prior form I’m combining the construction and testing of the next card in to a single post this time. Partly because this card is a nice easy one but also because it’s the first card that I’ll be partially constructing to begin with and then I’ll return to it later to add further functionality.
The card in question is the decoder which will take the value on the instruction bus and use it to decide which instruction class it represents. This class will then be used by the upcoming control card along with the sequencer pulses to operate the various control lines of the computer in the appropriate order. To begin with the decoder will recognise MOV8, ALU and SETAB instruction classes but there’ll be more added later on.</description></item><item><title>Register Construction: Instruction Register</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2015/05/register-construction-instruction/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 May 2015 20:01:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2015/05/register-construction-instruction/</guid><description>There’s been lots of theory going on in my recent posts but the time for design is over (for now) … it’s time to get constructing. The first card up in this batch is the instruction register and as it shares much of its design with the other register cards the construction is very similar.
The first step is to solder down the LEDs. Here’s some pictures, front and back, of the card following this first round of soldering:</description></item><item><title>New Workbench</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2015/05/new-workbench/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2015 11:19:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2015/05/new-workbench/</guid><description>Those who have been reading my posts and watching my videos (you have my sympathy) will know that alongside constructing this computer I’ve also been busy renovating a house I bought almost a year ago. This is mostly why there’s been a lot of theory and design going on for the relay computer and not much construction … I haven’t actually had anywhere to do the construction … until now that is.</description></item><item><title>User Interface: Display B Initial Design and Construction</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/07/user-interface-display-b-initial-design/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2014 10:05:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/07/user-interface-display-b-initial-design/</guid><description>In my last post I put together the beginnings of the first display card … named in a brilliant flash of nomenclature as display card A. This time I’m turning my attention to the second display card … named (can you guess) display card B.
Whereas display A is dual purpose allowing a user to view and initiate control signals the second display card is read-only and displays the primary state of the computer. Initially this ‘primary state’ comprises of the data bus contents, condition register status and ALU function code / operation. I also had a rectangular gap spare on the card that looked like it’d fit an ammeter so that also now forms part of the second display too.</description></item><item><title>User Interface: Display A Initial Design and Construction</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/07/user-interface-display-initial-design/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2014 10:31:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/07/user-interface-display-initial-design/</guid><description>Following on from working on the main data switches in my last post this time I’ve taken the first steps in designing and constructing the first of two display cards which will sit in the upper enclosure. The first card (display A) has a dual purpose … it provides a display to show which control signals are in operation between the various parts of the computer but also allows the operator to manually control those signals when the computer is set to a special ‘diagnostic’ mode.</description></item><item><title>User Interface: Data Switches</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/07/user-interface-data-switches/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2014 09:40:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/07/user-interface-data-switches/</guid><description>Now I’ve got a fully working ALU and four registers completed I want to take a short break from card building and turn my attention to making it easier to interact with the computer. Currently I’m controlling the computer via a set of DIP switches which is incredibly fiddly so it’s time to construct something ‘chunkier’.
The switches I’m going to concentrate on first are the primary data switches which permit values to be placed on the data bus. These switches won’t be directly connected to the data however because as a user you’d have to keep turning them all off so the computer can use the bus … instead I’ll build a gating circuit so the value on the switches can be placed on and off the bus as needed. Additionally the gating circuit will also allow the values on the switches to be gated over to the lower 8 bits of the 16 bit address bus. This will allow the quick setting of addresses once the computer gains its memory card and register. I was originally thinking of having a separate set of 16 switches for setting the address bus but decided in the end that I didn’t want to use the space up for something I didn’t think would get used that much. The upshot of this is that to set the upper 8 bits of the address bus requires gating the switches to the data bus and then loading the higher 8 bits on one of the 16 bit registers (like the upcoming M2, Y and J2 registers). That said, at the moment everything is manual until I build the data and address load circuitry so for now gating the switches on to the data bus would always be followed by a manual register load operation.</description></item><item><title>Register Construction: A and D 8-bit Registers</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/06/register-construction-and-d-8-bit/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jun 2014 18:35:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/06/register-construction-and-d-8-bit/</guid><description>I haven’t posted in nearly a month but in between bouts of enjoying the rare British sunshine I’ve been plodding away at the A/D register card and it’s now finally ready for testing.

Well, the short version of things is that I’ve admitted defeat and constructed a new backplane using a different design … it looks like this:
This design uses stackable headers instead of regular sockets so that the pins extend out of the back of the card far enough to attach an IDC connector. Each of these connectors can then be ‘daisy chained’ together with ribbon cable making construction relatively quick and easy to do.</description></item><item><title>Enclosure Initial Construction</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/03/enclosure-initial-construction/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2014 00:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/03/enclosure-initial-construction/</guid><description>I’ve been promising this post for quite a while now … an update on how the enclosure construction is going. Well, it’s very good thanks :)
Firstly, here’s a quick reminder of the SketchUp design showing how the enclosure should look:
… and here’s how it looks, so far, in reality …
This is the main frame of the card enclosure and you can see it forms four compartments that will hold five cards each plus backplanes. At the moment the front and back doors are incomplete as they’re waiting for the perspex/acrylic sheet (3mm smoked transparent) to be cut. Likewise the perspex that fits in the sides of the main frame are also pending. Because of this the frame as it appears above isn’t fully screwed together yet … the back bars (which kind of form a shape like two ‘E’s back to back) are just held in by friction on the corners. Once the side perspex panels are in then everything can be screwed together and a very rigid strong frame results. All the joints are held together with self tapping torx screws which are driven into the end of a piece of profile and then the screw head rests in the slot of a second piece of profile and is tightened with a screw driver via a drilled access hole.</description></item><item><title>ALU Construction: Completed Control Card Full Test</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/03/alu-construction-completed-control-card/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2014 08:59:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/03/alu-construction-completed-control-card/</guid><description>The ALU Control Card is now complete and looks like this:
This card was, on the whole, much simpler and quicker to put together than previous cards (despite me initially messing up the zero detection relay positions). As the card isn’t too busy I’ve arranged the wiring away from the empty part of the card so there’s room for future expansion or modifications if needed in the future. Not entirely sure what they’d actually be but you never know.</description></item><item><title>ALU Construction: Control Card Power Rails &amp; Wire Wrap</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/03/alu-construction-control-card-power/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2014 19:51:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/03/alu-construction-control-card-power/</guid><description>I’ve been a bit short of time lately so I’ve been working on the ALU Control Card in little bursts … but after lots of these little bursts I’ve now got all the power rails and wire wrap done for this card.

So, that’s two out of the three ALU cards done with just the control card left to do. Well, I say that … after the ALU is completed there’s all those registers let alone all the control and timing circuitry coming up … I’ll try not to think too much about the impending work for now.</description></item><item><title>ALU Construction: Arithmetic Card Wire Wrap 2</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/02/alu-construction-arithmetic-card-wire_19/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2014 22:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/02/alu-construction-arithmetic-card-wire_19/</guid><description>I’ve managed to squeeze in a couple more wire wrapping sessions this week so in this post there’s a few photos of progress so far.
Inputs B and C are fully wired in now as is the data bus output. As all the wiring is now complete on the arithmetic 1-bit units I’ve popped the relays in.
The next wire links to add are the control lines which select either the Add or Increment operation and then once that’s done the card should be ready for powering up and testing/debugging.</description></item><item><title>ALU Construction: Arithmetic Card Wire Wrap 1</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/02/alu-construction-arithmetic-card-wire/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2014 10:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/02/alu-construction-arithmetic-card-wire/</guid><description>Fear not (just in case you were for some reason) all this talk of Sketchup and enclosures and so on hasn’t totally diverted me from the main task of constructing the ALU. The wire wrap is coming along nicely on the arithmetic card although it has taken slightly more concentration than before to get all the wraps in the right places.

This is the last of the soldering for this card - it’s all wire wrapping form hereon in.
The rear of the card now looks like this:
The power rails are very similar to the ones of the logic card completed earlier and they were just as fiddly to complete too … although, that said, I do seem to be developing a bit of a ‘sixth sense’ for how long a wire should be cut without measuring it.</description></item><item><title>ALU Construction: 1-bit Arithmetic Full Construction</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/01/alu-construction-1-bit-arithmetic-full/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2014 18:25:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/01/alu-construction-1-bit-arithmetic-full/</guid><description>So, as mentioned in my last post this time I’ve put in the wire links and wraps needed to test the first bit of the arithmetic card.

As a quick reminder here’s the diagram for the 1-bit full adder:

Therefore it’s taken me a bit longer than it would otherwise to complete this stage of construction although to be fair I also got distracted with a Nixie clock kit my partner bought me for Christmas … and I ran out of solder (this time though I’ve finally stumped up the cash to buy a 500g reel which should keep me going for a good while). Anyho, after much procrastination all the sockets (and diodes) are now on.</description></item><item><title>ALU Construction: Arithmetic Card Header Pins</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/01/alu-construction-arithmetic-card-header/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2014 22:18:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2014/01/alu-construction-arithmetic-card-header/</guid><description>Following on from the successful construction of the ALU logic card in my last post it’s time to start off the new year with the next ALU card (number 2 of 3 ALU cards in total) … the arithmetic card.

As the old saying goes: a picture paints a thousand words … I’m not sure therefore how many words a video paints but it definitely seems the best way to demonstrate the card in operation. So, with that in mind, I’ve (painstakingly) put the following YouTube video together which gives a walkthrough of the ALU logic card in operation.

The final job is to wire up the gating relays that select one of the five logic results back on to the data bus. Nothing too difficult … just a case of routing the wires in the best way possible to keep things neat and out of the way of the relay sockets.
Keeping with the same wiring colour convention as before the green wires are the results heading out to the data bus, the blue wires are the inputs B and C and the yellow wires are the control lines which activate each of the gating relays as required.</description></item><item><title>ALU Construction: 8-bit Logic Unit Tests</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2013/12/alu-construction-8-bit-logic-unit-tests/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2013 19:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2013/12/alu-construction-8-bit-logic-unit-tests/</guid><description>There’s now enough sockets, solder and wires to test all eight bits of the ALU logic card. This isn’t quite a full test as the gating relays that apply one of the results produced by each bit unit haven’t been wired up yet but there’s enough there to be able to set an input and see the results displayed on the LEDs along the front of the card.
So, it’s time to crack out the relays and pop them in the sockets that make up each logic bit unit. There’s four relays needed in each logic bit unit so thats 32 relays in total and this is what it looks like:</description></item><item><title>ALU Construction: Logic Card Wire Wrap 2</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2013/12/alu-construction-logic-card-wire-wrap-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2013 18:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2013/12/alu-construction-logic-card-wire-wrap-2/</guid><description>Continuing on with the wire wrapping for the ALU logic card next up is the input and result links:
Given the limited range of colours I’ve got to choose from (Black, Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) I’ve chosen the following scheme for the wire links:
Black: Internal wire links Red: Power links Blue: Input links Green: Result links Yellow: Control links I’ll no doubt break this convention at some point but in general it should make the cards a little bit easier to fathom out at first glance … especially as the number of wires on the board increases.</description></item><item><title>ALU Construction: Logic Card Wire Wrap 1</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2013/12/alu-construction-logic-card-wire-wrap-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2013 18:41:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2013/12/alu-construction-logic-card-wire-wrap-1/</guid><description>Finally, with all the soldering now done, it’s time to set about wire wrapping the ALU logic card. First up is the internal connections within each logic bit:
After wire wrapping a new set of wires I always run the multimeter over the board to double check everything is connected as intended. Again though, if there are any mis-wirings it’s trivial to correct — just unwrap the wire and wrap in a new one. There is a bit of skill required to get a ‘perfect’ wrap (where a bit of the insulation is taken around the post followed by nice tight coils above that) and mine are certainly not all perfect but bad ones can always be re-done.</description></item><item><title>ALU Construction: Logic Card Power Rails</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2013/12/alu-construction-logic-card-power-rails/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2013 22:56:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2013/12/alu-construction-logic-card-power-rails/</guid><description>It seems that every time I move on to the next stage of construction on the ALU logic card it’s fiddlier than the stage before it … this stage is no exception. This time I’m adding the power and ground rails that run around the solder side of the board. I’ll start with a picture of how it looks:
The really, really, fiddly bit this time is cutting all those lengths of (solid single core) wire to the required length and then stripping the insulator, bending the ends and soldering down — nothing complex … just fiddly. As part of adding these rails I’ve laid down some additional header pins up the middle of the board to get power to the relay gates as needed. Following usual convention the 12V power rails are in red and the ground rails are in black.</description></item><item><title>Test Board: Construction</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2013/12/test-board-construction/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2013 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2013/12/test-board-construction/</guid><description>I’ve just realised that as I’ve been constructing the first ALU card I’ve not given much thought to how I’ll actually test the card (or other cards for that matter) when complete … this post therefore represents a quick aside to tackle testing.
What I’m looking for is a small board with enough switches on it to drive the various inputs of each card … ideally it’ll be reusable between cards and easy to use. I did originally think of using DIP switches but they’re a bit on the fiddly side so I’ve gone for tactile switches instead — the main problem with these is that they’re non latching but I figure that I won’t need to push more than 10 buttons at a time hopefully.</description></item><item><title>ALU Construction: Logic Card Relay Sockets</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2013/12/alu-construction-logic-card-relay/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2013 07:27:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2013/12/alu-construction-logic-card-relay/</guid><description>The construction of the ALU logic card is coming along nicely but there’s still a lot of soldering ahead to get all the relay sockets down … and this part is the fiddliest bit yet.
The biggest issue I’ve found getting the sockets in place is that unlike the header pins, which tend to stay in place on the board whilst you solder them, the sockets will keep falling out. Usually if I’m soldering components down I’ll work in order of height from shortest to tallest so that when the board is turned over the components have nowhere to go … unfortunately because I started with the LEDs first there’s nothing to hold the sockets in place when soldering. To get around this I’ve had to develop a new skill where I hold the socket in with a finger on one hand and then pick and place a blob of solder with the other hand (remembering which pin I’ve got my finger on to avoid a nasty burn). Needless to say I’ll try and make sure I do things in the ‘right’ order on the other cards ;)</description></item><item><title>ALU Construction: Logic Card Header Pins</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2013/12/alu-construction-logic-card-header-pins/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2013 09:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2013/12/alu-construction-logic-card-header-pins/</guid><description>Following on from the successful construction of the first bit on the ALU logic card in my last post it’s now time to start putting together the other 7 bits and the gating circuits (to place one of the logic results on to the data bus). First up is soldering down all the header pins that I’ll wire wrap to.
This part of the construction is certainly repetitive and it’s easy to make mistakes … and actually I made a couple within placing down the first few headers. Suffice to say that it’s a lot easier to solder multi-leg components than it is to unsolder them. Here’s the result of this evenings work:</description></item><item><title>ALU Construction: 1-bit Logic Full Construction</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2013/12/alu-construction-1-bit-logic-full/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2013 01:54:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2013/12/alu-construction-1-bit-logic-full/</guid><description>So, although I probably should construct the logic card methodically a full stage at a time (solder header pins then sockets then wire wrap) I can’t resist fully assembling a single bit alone to see if/how it works. Here of some pictures of that single bit all soldered in and wired up:
This is the first bit logic unit out of 8 in total and effectively the pattern is repeated 4 times across the board and for 2 rows up the board. One thing I was definitely reminded of when putting this first bit together is how small components on a 0.1 inch pitch actually are and it really is quite fiddly work. Again, the soldering is a bit grizzly where I’ve joined several pads together and couldn’t keep the heat up and solder flowing.</description></item><item><title>ALU Construction: LED Tests</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2013/12/alu-construction-led-tests/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Dec 2013 20:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2013/12/alu-construction-led-tests/</guid><description>Following on from my last post I can now test the LEDs that have been soldered and hooked up to the header pins on each of the three ALU cards (Logic, Arithmetic and Control). As promised, here are the videos of said testing:
You might notice I’m prodding around slightly more carefully on the arithmetic and control cards … due to a lack of foresight I’ve ended up with every second header pin being a direct line to 0v … which is not great when the thing I’m holding has 12v at the tip. Luckily my power supply handles short circuits well but even the briefest of sparks can be a tad embarrassing. At some point I’ll chop off the extraneous header pins (as they’re not needed) to ensure I don’t accidentally wire-wrap to one of them later on.</description></item><item><title>ALU Construction: Logic Card Wire Links</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2013/12/alu-construction-logic-card-wire-links/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Dec 2013 20:51:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2013/12/alu-construction-logic-card-wire-links/</guid><description>Before I can test all of the LEDs laid down so far (to make sure they survived the heat of the soldering iron) I need to add some wire links on the logic card between the LED anodes and the header pins.

It’s now time to solder in some header pins and join them to the existing connectors and LEDs ready for wire-wrapping later.
You can get proper wire-wrap posts but they’re really expensive for what they are (mainly, I guess, because it’s quite an old-fashioned construction method). I’ve found, though, that header pins do the job just as well but being as they’re not as tall you can only get a maximum of two wraps on each pin. Incidentally, I’ve chosen wire-wrap for most of the cards inner connections as it allows easy and quick modifications and correction of errors (something that can be quite difficult with soldered connections or pretty impossible with etched PCBs). Additionally, I quite like the finished look you get with wire-wrap.</description></item><item><title>Backplane Design and Construction</title><link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2013/12/backplane-design-and-construction/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2013 19:27:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/posts/2013/12/backplane-design-and-construction/</guid><description>Originally when I was thinking about how I’d connect up the various cards of this computer I had ribbon cables in mind.

allow me to work out how I’d physically arrange the cards later on. However, the more I thought about it the more I liked the idea of using a backplane that the cards would slot in to — a bit like those 19 inch server racks that take CPU cards.

I’m going start by laying down the connectors and LEDs on each card to make sure I’m happy with the look and feel of things and then I can move on to everything else needed later.
As mentioned in earlier posts I’m basing my construction around 55 x 40 hole pad boards which fit my designs quite nicely at the right sort of size I’m looking to construct at. The connectors are right angled box headers and are simply soldered down to the back of the boards whilst the LEDs run along the front. The LEDs themselves are 3mm 12V types so that an additional resistor is not required (which would make the ‘crammed in’ Logic unit design even more tricky) and to make construction a bit more manageable each LED sits in a right angled holder.</description></item></channel></rss>
