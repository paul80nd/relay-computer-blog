First up is soldering down all the header pins that I’ll wire wrap to.
This part of the construction is certainly repetitive and it’s easy to make mistakes … and actually I made a couple within placing down the first few headers. Suffice to say that it’s a lot easier to solder multi-leg components than it is to unsolder them. Here’s the result of this evenings work:</description></item></channel></rss>
