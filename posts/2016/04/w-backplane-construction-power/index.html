working together with the rest of the computer I need to construct the &lsquo;W&rsquo;
backplane which the new cards sit on. Generally this backplane is similar in
design to the &lsquo;Z&rsquo; backplane that the ALU cards and A/D and B/C register cards
sit on. However, whereas each card on the Z backplane has the exact same
connectors the W backplane is slightly more complex as the sequencer and
control units are spread over two cards each requiring a different set of
connectors. The upshot is that the backplane has three &lsquo;W1&rsquo; card slots and two
&lsquo;W2&rsquo; card slots. A diagram explains it better:</p><figure><img src=/img/posts/2016/2016-04-11-0000.png alt="W Backplane Diagram"><figcaption markdown=span>W Backplane Diagram (<a href=/img/posts/2016/2016-04-11-1000.png>larger</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>On the
Z backplane each individual connector is joined to it&rsquo;s siblings via a ribbon
cable that runs the length of the backplane. The only oddity is that at the
bottom of the backplane each pair of wires in the ribbon cable need twisting
so that each line comes out in the right place. As you can see from the
diagram above the W backplane is a bit more of a challenge. I&rsquo;m still using
ribbon cables to join the connectors together however this time the cables
need to weave in and out to fit around the other connectors which are in the
way. After much coaxing of wires I ended up with the following:</p><figure><img src=/img/posts/2016/2016-04-11-0001.jpg alt="W Backplane Rear View"></figure><p>&mldr;
and when viewed from the front the backplane looks like this:</p><figure><img src=/img/posts/2016/2016-04-11-0002.jpg alt="W Backplane Front View"></figure><p>&mldr;
and that&rsquo;s about it for the backplane although behind the scenes constructing
the backplane is of course very time consuming and fiddly and takes careful
testing to make sure all lines are connected OK. Fortunately the computer only
has two other backplanes (X and Y) and those are very similar to the Z
backplane so should be a bit easier to put together.</p><p>As the
computer is gaining ever more cards I also wanted to start work on putting
something more permanent together for distributing the power to each of the
backplanes and display cards. Here is the power distribution board I&rsquo;ve put
together:</p><figure><img src=/img/posts/2016/2016-04-11-0003.jpg alt="Power Distribution Board (Front Top)">
<img src=/img/posts/2016/2016-04-11-0004.jpg alt="Power Distribution Board (Front Rear)">
<img src=/img/posts/2016/2016-04-11-0005.jpg alt="Power Distribution Board (Rear View)"></figure><p>The board has five independent channels each fed from a metal tab,
through a fuse and then in to a screw terminal. These provide the primary 12V
feed for the W, X, Y and Z backplanes along with the front panel
operation/display cards. The 5 fuses are rated at 2A each which should be
plenty for each backplane of 5 cards and will catch any short circuits or
unexpected current consumption. Each of the backplanes and cards need the
negative power return of course and these come in on the screw terminals which
are all soldered together and off to the metal two metal tabs at the left and
right of the board. Finally there&rsquo;s a &lsquo;Vd&rsquo; connection on each of the screw
terminal blocks which distributes power for things that should only be powered
when the computer is in &lsquo;diagnostic/debugging&rsquo; mode. The Vd supply isn&rsquo;t used
by any of the backplanes yet but it&rsquo;s there just in case.</p><p>The power
distribution board is connected to each of the backplanes/cards via a power
cable which has the three wires (12V, Ground and Vd) braided together ending
in two female 5 way connectors stuck together and heat shrinked which can then
be plugged in to the right angled 10 way IDC connector of each backplane/card.
Here is a picture of the Z power cable:</p><figure><img src=/img/posts/2016/2016-04-11-0006.jpg alt="Power Distribution Cable"></figure><p>That&rsquo;s it then, with the backplane and power distribution in place
I can now demonstrate all of the parts of the computer constructed so far
working together and that&rsquo;ll be covered in my next post.</p></div><div class="field is-grouped is-grouped-multiline"><div class=control><a href=/archive#2016 class="tags has-addons"><span class="tag is-link">Published</span>
