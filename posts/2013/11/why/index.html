<meta name=description content="Whenever I tell people I’m building a relay computer the overwhelming response is … why on Earth would you want to do that?!

In fact it’s difficult to think of a real use for it as I’ll be left with something that could be outperformed by a pocket calculator (not a scientific calculator mind, more the kind you might find in a Christmas cracker). So why would I invest lots of time and effort in to making a relay computer?

is &mldr; why on Earth would you want to do that?! Or alternatively, as a work
colleague delicately put it to me yesterday, if you go to the front of your
house there&rsquo;s a big block of wood that opens — it&rsquo;s called a door — if you go
through it you&rsquo;ll discover pubs and things. They&rsquo;ve all got a point though,
this project will be very time consuming and I&rsquo;ve not particularly got a use
in mind for the resulting jumble of wires. In fact it&rsquo;s difficult to think of
a real use for it as I&rsquo;ll be left with something that could be outperformed by
a pocket calculator (not a scientific calculator mind, more the kind you might
find in a Christmas cracker). So why would I invest lots of time and effort in
to making a relay computer? Well, as they say (rather tritely) it&rsquo;s the
journey not the destination.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve always been interested in
electronics. As a child I would delight in taking things apart to see how they
worked; always marvelling at those green circuit boards within with all the
variety of bits and bobs soldered to them. This intrigue was all usually at
the expense, literally, of my parents as I&rsquo;d tend to have far more success
taking things apart than I would putting them back together again. Naturally
as I got older I started to learn a little more and started putting shop
bought kits together — usually complete failures as I&rsquo;d cook the components
with my clumsy soldering but there were some successes. I didn&rsquo;t stick around
for A levels at school but after a couple of years working in reprographics
for a local screen printers I decided it was time to get back in to education
and learn some more &mldr; electronics still the natural choice for me.
Unfortunately the time I decided to get on with electronics was also the time
the college canned the courses through lack of interest. Given this I decided
to plump for my second interest &mldr; software development.</p><p>So here I
am now thirty-six years of age and programming computers is now my day job and
has been since college. Actually, being a software developer (or computer
programmer, software engineer or whatever it is we&rsquo;re calling ourselves this
season) has become my first love now; I find it deeply satisfying. My interest
in electronics has never really gone away though — it&rsquo;s been hibernating —
waiting to be awoken again when the right project comes along. Trouble is I&rsquo;ve
never had anything I fancy making &mldr; then it hit me &mldr; I use computers day
in day out but I don&rsquo;t really have all that much of an appreciation for how
they really work under the hood. Even when I was a kid and computers were much
simpler you could understand the overall architecture but it was all just
theory in a way. I remember my parents bought me a spectrum +2a for the not
inconsiderable sum of £129.99 (we actually got through three of them — each
week taking the latest one back to Dixons for a replacement due to tape deck
faults). Once I&rsquo;d exhausted all the games that came with it I got in to
programming in BASIC and then eventually I delved into assembly language. That
gave me a real feel for what the computer was actually doing but it still
seemed quite advanced and a long way from where computers had actually started
from. The seed was therefore sown — if I wanted to get a feel for where
computers had come from I should get acquainted with some really old computers
— if I really, really, wanted to get a feel for where computers had come from
I should have a go at building something like a really old computer.</p><p>It just so happened a few months later that on a visit to see my folks &lsquo;oop
north&rsquo; I popped into the <a href=http://www.tnmoc.org/>National Museum of Computing</a>
(highly recommended if you&rsquo;re
of a certain age and want to be filled to the brim with nostalgia). They had
recently completed the <a href=http://www.tnmoc.org/special-projects/harwell-dekatron-witch>Harwell Dekatron</a>
restoration (also known as WITCH),
restored so successfully in fact that the computer was happily operating away
to itself on the day I visited. There&rsquo;s a certain beauty to the machine — all
the flashing lights and clicking relays. It&rsquo;s certainly not dainty — you
wouldn&rsquo;t want it sat on your foot — but there&rsquo;s just a certain something about
it. It was at this point where I decided to kill all my birds with one
boulder - I would create something that had a nod to the machines of this era;
learn more about electronics along the way (using the old fashioned learning method
of trial and error) and get that first hand understanding how computers really
work. Even better I&rsquo;d get to make my own assembler and if I really, really,
fancied it might even make a high level language compiler for it (assuming I
haven&rsquo;t died of old age by then of course).</p><p>So there we have it —
this is a project that&rsquo;s about satisfying curiosity and interest; a project
about exercising creativity and problem solving; a project about making theory
concrete and tangible. Ultimately it&rsquo;s a hobby — I&rsquo;ll still go to the gym,
socialise, get nicely drunk at the pub — but it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m looking
forward to and even a little bit excited over. Soldering irons at the ready?
Yes? Then off we go &mldr;</p></div><div class="field is-grouped is-grouped-multiline"><div class=control><span class="tags has-addons"><span class="tag is-link">Published</span>
