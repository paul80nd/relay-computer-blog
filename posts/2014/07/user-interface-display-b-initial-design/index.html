card &mldr; named in a brilliant flash of nomenclature as display card A. This
time I&rsquo;m turning my attention to the second display card &mldr; named (can you
guess) display card B.</p><p>Whereas display A is dual purpose allowing a
user to view and initiate control signals the second display card is read-only
and displays the primary state of the computer. Initially this &lsquo;primary state&rsquo;
comprises of the data bus contents, condition register status and ALU function
code / operation. I also had a rectangular gap spare on the card that looked
like it&rsquo;d fit an ammeter so that also now forms part of the second display
too.</p><p>As with the display A buttons and the primary input switches
I&rsquo;ve known what kind of display elements I wanted to use right from the
beginning. Taking inspiration from a visit to the
<a href=http://www.tnmoc.org/>National Museum of Computing</a>
in the UK I fell for the big chunky buttons/indicators on the ICL 2966&rsquo;s
&lsquo;washing machines&rsquo; / storage units. Here&rsquo;s an example of my interpretation of
that retro look:</p><figure><img src=/img/posts/2014/2014-07-20-0000.JPG alt="Indicator unit close up"></figure><p>Here I&rsquo;ve
applied a nice chunky letraset font directly to the faces of an Avago light
bar unit. These units come in a variety of bar shapes so that within the same
package outline the face area is divided in to one, two or four discrete lit
segments. Each package lights up green, yellow or red (all segments within a
package the same colour) and although the ones above are red they appear the
same milky white colour until actually lit. Finally, these units are also X-Y
stackable so it&rsquo;s quite easy to build up complex displays.</p><p>With the
selection of display units in hand I&rsquo;m now able to design the display card
itself. As with display card A I&rsquo;m only sharing a partial design for this card
&mldr; effectively as much as I&rsquo;ll actually be constructing. Eventually the gaps
on this card will be filled by yet more indicators for the various bits of the
computer I&rsquo;ll add in the future. This is more about constructing the bits I
need when I need them and saving money on parts until I&rsquo;m ready for them
rather than teasing my audience (if anyone really, really would like to see
the complete design for any of these partial cards drop me a line in the
comments and I&rsquo;ll be happy to share). Anyho, here is the design with indicator
faces shown:</p><figure><img src=/img/posts/2014/2014-07-20-0001.png alt="Display B Schematic"><figcaption markdown=span>Display B Schematic (<a href=/img/posts/2014/2014-07-20-1000.png>larger</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The lower left
indicators show the condition register status (Sign, Carry and Zero). The
lower right indicators show the current value on the data bus. The upper right
indicators show the ALU function code along with the decoded ALU operation and
also the Condition Register Load line. Finally there&rsquo;s the rectangle in the
upper left of the card that marks the outline of the ammeter. The same diagram
with the indicator faces removed looks like this:</p><figure><img src=/img/posts/2014/2014-07-20-0002.png alt="Display B Schematic (indicator faces removed)"><figcaption markdown=span>Display B Schematic (indicator faces removed) (<a href=/img/posts/2014/2014-07-20-1001.png>larger</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>If you look at this diagram close up (you can click the picture
above to view a larger version) you can see that each of the indicator units
has the same internal layout of LEDs which makes wiring up much easier. Each
LED anode is connected to the appropriate header pin bringing in the signal
from the rest of the computer. On the cathode side of each LED is a single 1K
resistor packaged up in an array of eight resistors. This is higher than the
560 ohm resistor used on the display A buttons to try and match the light
levels a little better (running these units at their rated current was way too
bright and actually a bit unpleasant to look at &mldr; bringing them down with a
1K resistor made them just about right).</p><p>As always these schematics
are available in PDF format <a href=/pdf/display-b-1.pdf>here for the schematic with indicator faces</a> and <a href=/pdf/display-b-1a.pdf>here for the schematic without</a>.</p><p>So with the
design all done I can move on to making the card for real. Technique wise
there&rsquo;s nothing really new compared to constructing display card A although I
have put in some DIL sockets to carry the display units just in case I ever
need to replace them or tweak anything. To fit the ammeter I made a paper
template first and then marked out the area on the card / pad board and
drilled some pilot holes. From there I attempted to cut out the hole with a
junior hacksaw but didn&rsquo;t get very far so I resorted to nibbling away at the
board with a pair of pliers which actually worked very well. Here&rsquo;s the card
as it currently stands from the front:</p><figure><img src=/img/posts/2014/2014-07-20-0003.JPG alt="Display B (front)"></figure><p>The condition
register display units aren&rsquo;t shown here on this picture as they were out of
stock when I ordered them so arrived after this picture was taken (originally
these were going to be red indicators but it was a 6 week wait for those so I
switched out for the green equivalent which actually ended up looking better).
The four spacers with screws in each corner of the card are a temporary
addition which allows me to work on the back of the card without scratching
the front of the card to bits. Speaking of the back of the card &mldr; that looks
like this:</p><figure><img src=/img/posts/2014/2014-07-20-0004.JPG alt="Display B (back)"></figure><p>Here&rsquo;s a couple of
close up pictures of the card back:</p><figure><img src=/img/posts/2014/2014-07-20-0005.JPG alt="Close up of the ALU display connections">
<img src=/img/posts/2014/2014-07-20-0006.jpg alt="Close up of the data bus display connections"></figure><p>&mldr; and here&rsquo;s a couple of close ups on the indicator units &mldr;</p><figure><img src=/img/posts/2014/2014-07-20-0007.JPG alt="Data Bus Indicators">
<img src=/img/posts/2014/2014-07-20-0008.JPG alt="ALU Indicator Units"></figure><p>&mldr; and that&rsquo;s it
for now on this card. I&rsquo;ve tested everything lights up correctly but I&rsquo;m not
posting any photos of that just yet - I&rsquo;ll leave that for the next post when I
hook up the primary switches and display A and B to the rest of the computer
and give it a whirl. I&rsquo;ll also produce another video (don&rsquo;t groan) showing
everything built so far working fully.</p></div><div class="field is-grouped is-grouped-multiline"><div class=control><span class="tags has-addons"><span class="tag is-link">Published</span>
