I ended up with the following circuit per 8-bit register:</p><figure><img src=/img/posts/2014/2014-04-24-0000.png alt="8-bit Register Design"><figcaption markdown=span>8-bit Register Design (<a href=/img/posts/2014/2014-04-24-1000.png>larger</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>In this design
the spare pad on the left of each of the lower relays feeds an LED to show the
status of each register bit. This pad is isolated from the register bit
circuitry itself by making use of the second DPDT switch on each bit relay.
The B and C registers will also need this LED feed but additionally need to
provide a permanent feed of the current value in each register bit to the ALU.
However, I can&rsquo;t just piggyback on the pad used to light the LED because
there&rsquo;s a risk that the LEDs could light up in error if anything back feeds up
the B or C ALU lines (thereby obscuring the actual value held in the
register). A better solution is to isolate the LED feed from the ALU feed
however this then requires an extra relay per bit because I&rsquo;ll then need three
DPDT switches rather than the two used above. Diagram wise it&rsquo;d look like
this:</p><figure><img src=/img/posts/2014/2014-04-24-0001.png alt="8-bit Register Design with additional output"><figcaption markdown=span>8-bit Register Design with additional output (<a href=/img/posts/2014/2014-04-24-1001.png>larger</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>In this design there is now the required two pads available per
relay &mldr; one for the LED and one for the ALU feed. However, doubling the
number of relays also means double the current consumption for each bit that&rsquo;s
holding a value &mldr; double the cost in relays &mldr; double the soldering &mldr;
double the frustration etc etc. One way around this would be to stick with the
single pad design (with one relay per bit) and place a diode in the feed to
the ALU so that back feed cannot occur. This doesn&rsquo;t come for &lsquo;free&rsquo; though
and needs some consideration to the effect the diode will have on the ALU feed
itself.</p><p>The first concern would be the voltage drop across a diode.
Assuming a silicon diode is used the voltage drop would typically be 0.7V and
so based on a supply of 12V the voltage downstream of the diode would reduce
to 11.3V. According to the data sheets for the relays I&rsquo;m using (the TE/Axicom
V23079-A2003-B301) they&rsquo;ll be happy with anything down to 9V before they&rsquo;ll
refuse to operate so things should be OK here. In fact I could get away with
three diodes in series (maybe even four at a push) before I&rsquo;d run in to
problems.</p><p>With the first concern ticked off the next one would be
over the current flowing through the diode. Each of the relays I&rsquo;m using
consumes around 11mA whilst the coil is energised (based on a 12V supply and a
coil resistance of 1029 ohms &mldr; assuming I&rsquo;ve followed ohms law correctly of
course ;). A typical signal diode like the 1N4001 can pass up to 100mA before
it&rsquo;ll get a sweat on so in theory I could feed 9 relays through the diode
without problems. This point actually raises a greater issue which I always
have in the back of mind when designing the various parts of this computer &mldr;
fan out.</p><p>Fan out (in the design of this computer at least) is a
measure of how many relays I can drive from a single output of a single relay
switch (assuming that switch is fed directly by the power source as it is in
the above diagrams). The voltage in this case isn&rsquo;t so much of a concern
because relays in parallel will receive the same voltage but the current of
multiple relays will add up and could cause issues. Actually, my worry about
the max diode current is actually second place to the amount of current the
wire wrap wire itself is happy passing. This &lsquo;Kynar&rsquo; wire is gauged at 30AWG
and I&rsquo;m working on the basis that it can carry around 100mA (as a conservative
estimate). Converting that 100mA to my preferred currency comes out at 9
relays. Because of this limit I&rsquo;ve always got a 9 relay fan out limit in my
head to keep things within limits and in practice most individual outputs
wouldn&rsquo;t feed more than a couple of outputs at a time. When manually operating
the computer it could be possible to do something silly (like load multiple
registers off the data bus simultaneously) but even then I&rsquo;m pretty sure
things would be within limits. Fortunately if I do find anywhere is getting a
bit &lsquo;hot&rsquo; design wise I can always lay down multiple wire wraps between two
points to increase the current carrying capacity.</p><p>Anyho, that&rsquo;s
settled, I&rsquo;ll use a diode to keep the feeds isolated and therefore I can use
the same &lsquo;one relay per bit&rsquo; design used in the A and D registers. I&rsquo;ll put
together a full schematic for the B and C registers now and then post them up
here in due course. Incidentally, in other news my laser cutting has been
dispatched so should be with me in the next couple of days so I&rsquo;m not going to
be able to resist putting that together and posting about it so it&rsquo;ll probably
be an enclosure post next followed by a register post.</p></div><div class="field is-grouped is-grouped-multiline"><div class=control><a href=/archive#2014 class="tags has-addons"><span class="tag is-link">Published</span>
