      <description>In my last two posts I covered the construction of the upper and lower incrementer cards. The lower card is a 16-bit half adder and the upper card is a 16-bit register.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re getting nearer and nearer to a computer that can run though a program in memory rather than just a single instruction &amp;hellip; we&amp;rsquo;ve got memory to hold the program and a program counter to point to the current instruction in memory.</description>

      <description>In my last post I covered the design of the 16-bit half adder which takes whatever value is currently on the address bus and increments it by one.</description>

      <description>In the last post I introduced the design for the 1-bit Half Adder. This post covers connecting sixteen of these units together to make the 16-bit Half Adder.</description>

      <description>Typical isn&amp;rsquo;t it?! &amp;hellip; you wait 10 months for a post and then two come along at once. Well, all being well, this should be the first of a short flurry of posts as I move on to the design of the incrementer.</description>
