      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a bit quiet on the relay computer front again for a while &amp;hellip; well it is summer after all and there&amp;rsquo;s no point staying inside the house tending to my hobbies when I can be running around outside getting sunburnt. Of course though, this is the UK and summer consists mostly of rain (as do most of the other seasons here) so what other excuse do I have for not posting in ages?</description>
