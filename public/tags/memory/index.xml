      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve covered the construction of the upper and lower memory cards in my last two posts &amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s now time to bring those two cards together to form the memory unit proper and give it all a test.</description>

      <description>In my last post I made a start on the memory unit construction with the lower memory card. The lower card centres around the memory IC which runs at 5V.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to make a start on the construction of the memory unit and as mentioned in my last post this one is a bit more complex than &amp;lsquo;boring old registers&amp;rsquo; and so I&amp;rsquo;ll split it over two posts.</description>

      <description>In my last post I started the design for the computer&amp;rsquo;s memory unit which is spread over two cards. With the lower memory card design in place its now time to finish the job and design the upper card which will interface the rest of the computer with the memory chip of the lower card.</description>

      <description>In my last post I explained my decision to use a &amp;lsquo;modern&amp;rsquo; memory chip in my relay computer &amp;hellip; I also alluded to there being some complexities in interfacing the rest of the computer with that memory chip.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time, at last, to start looking at the design for the computer&amp;rsquo;s memory and this is a bit of a game changer as it&amp;rsquo;s the final part of the jigsaw that lets the computer run a program.</description>
