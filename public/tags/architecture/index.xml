      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a bit quiet on the relay computer front again for a while &amp;hellip; well it is summer after all and there&amp;rsquo;s no point staying inside the house tending to my hobbies when I can be running around outside getting sunburnt.</description>

      <title>Instruction Set</title>

      <description>In the last post I promised to reveal the planned instruction set for the computer and [here it is]({% link /assets/pdf/instruction-set.pdf %}) (pdf file).
This should be viewed alongside the architecture diagram which can be found in my previous architecture posts &amp;hellip; and to be fair if you&amp;rsquo;ve been following along through my recent posts then just close your eyes &amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;ll probably find it&amp;rsquo;s been burnt on to your eye balls given the amount of times I&amp;rsquo;ve posted it ;)</description>

      <title>Architectural breakdown: Programming and Control 2</title>
      <link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/2013/11/architectural-breakdown-programming-and_7.html</link>

      <description>So, the last post didn&amp;rsquo;t quite wrap up this &amp;lsquo;mini-series&amp;rsquo; but hopefully this one will. Continuing on with how the Programming and Control of the computer happens here again, for the last time (really last time), is the architecture I&amp;rsquo;ll be building against (from the Harry Porter Relay Computer)</description>

      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll wrap up this &amp;lsquo;mini-series&amp;rsquo; of trying to explain away the various bits of the architecture that will make up my relay computer project — finally now we come on to Programming and Control of the computer.</description>

      <title>Architectural breakdown: Binary</title>

      <guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/2013/11/architectural-breakdown-binary.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;hellip; and it all begins with binary. Binary is a &amp;lsquo;base 2&amp;rsquo; numbering system which means it uses the numbers 0 and 1. In contrast humans tend to use decimal (base 10) for their day-to-day numerical needs which, of course, uses the numbers 0 to 9.</description>

      <description>So, with the scene now set (see previous posts) let&amp;rsquo;s dive right in and take a look at the system architecture I&amp;rsquo;ll be building my computer upon &amp;hellip; here it is &amp;hellip;</description>
