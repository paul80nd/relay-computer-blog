      <description>Now that the two display cards are complete enough to display and control the status of the ALU and four registers (A-D) it&amp;rsquo;s time to fit them to the upper enclosure.</description>

      <description>In my last post I mentioned I&amp;rsquo;d suffered a bit of a set back with the construction of the ALU backplane. Well, the short version of things is that I&amp;rsquo;ve admitted defeat and constructed a new backplane using a different design &amp;hellip; it looks like this:</description>

      <description>The ALU Control Card is now complete and looks like this:

This card was, on the whole, much simpler and quicker to put together than previous cards (despite me initially messing up the zero detection relay positions).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a bit short of time lately so I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the ALU Control Card in little bursts &amp;hellip; but after lots of these little bursts I&amp;rsquo;ve now got all the power rails and wire wrap done for this card.</description>

As I did for the ALU logic card before I&amp;rsquo;ve put the following YouTube video together which gives a walkthrough of the arithmetic card in operation &amp;hellip; and as before this one also has a narrative track delivered by my own fair gob.</description>

      <description>Another round of soldering done &amp;hellip; this time putting down the power rails on the arithmetic card along with some soldered wire links. This is the last of the soldering for this card - it&amp;rsquo;s all wire wrapping form hereon in.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s always a fiddly job getting the relay sockets soldered in and the ALU arithmetic card proved no exception. With this in mind I&amp;rsquo;ve been spreading the work out over several mini sessions in accordance with my new post-Xmas lack of patience.</description>

      <guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/2013/12/alu-construction-logic-card-wire-wrap-3.html</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m now just one session of wire wrapping away from a completed ALU logic card. The final job is to wire up the gating relays that select one of the five logic results back on to the data bus.</description>

      <guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/2013/12/alu-construction-8-bit-logic-unit-tests.html</guid>
      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s now enough sockets, solder and wires to test all eight bits of the ALU logic card. This isn&amp;rsquo;t quite a full test as the gating relays that apply one of the results produced by each bit unit haven&amp;rsquo;t been wired up yet but there&amp;rsquo;s enough there to be able to set an input and see the results displayed on the LEDs along the front of the card.</description>

      <description>It seems that every time I move on to the next stage of construction on the ALU logic card it&amp;rsquo;s fiddlier than the stage before it &amp;hellip; this stage is no exception.</description>

      <guid>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/2013/12/alu-construction-logic-card-relay.html</guid>
      <description>The construction of the ALU logic card is coming along nicely but there&amp;rsquo;s still a lot of soldering ahead to get all the relay sockets down &amp;hellip; and this part is the fiddliest bit yet.</description>

      <description>Following on from the successful construction of the first bit on the ALU logic card in my last post it&amp;rsquo;s now time to start putting together the other 7 bits and the gating circuits (to place one of the logic results on to the data bus).</description>

      <description>So, although I probably should construct the logic card methodically a full stage at a time (solder header pins then sockets then wire wrap) I can&amp;rsquo;t resist fully assembling a single bit alone to see if/how it works.</description>
