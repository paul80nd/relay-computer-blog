      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a bit quiet on the relay computer front again for a while &amp;hellip; well it is summer after all and there&amp;rsquo;s no point staying inside the house tending to my hobbies when I can be running around outside getting sunburnt. Of course though, this is the UK and summer consists mostly of rain (as do most of the other seasons here) so what other excuse do I have for not posting in ages?</description>

      <description>In the last post I promised to reveal the planned instruction set for the computer and here it is (pdf file).
This should be viewed alongside the architecture diagram which can be found in my previous architecture posts &amp;hellip; and to be fair if you&amp;rsquo;ve been following along through my recent posts then just close your eyes &amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;ll probably find it&amp;rsquo;s been burnt on to your eye balls given the amount of times I&amp;rsquo;ve posted it ;)</description>
