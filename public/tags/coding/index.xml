      <description>To make my relay computer do something interesting (or anything at all) it needs a list of instructions held in memory. Each instruction consists of an 8-bit value called an opcode (portmanteau of operation and code) optionally followed by one or two further 8-bit values (usually referencing a location in memory). The computer will work through them one at a time doing whatever operation that opcode represents. Hereâ€™s an example program:</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a bit quiet on the relay computer front again for a while &amp;hellip; well it is summer after all and there&amp;rsquo;s no point staying inside the house tending to my hobbies when I can be running around outside getting sunburnt.

      <description>In the last post I promised to reveal the planned instruction set for the computer and here it is (pdf file).
This should be viewed alongside the architecture diagram which can be found in my previous architecture posts &amp;hellip; and to be fair if you&amp;rsquo;ve been following along through my recent posts then just close your eyes &amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;ll probably find it&amp;rsquo;s been burnt on to your eye balls given the amount of times I&amp;rsquo;ve posted it ;)</description>
