      <description>In my last post I covered off the full design for the decoder card so all that remains is to get it soldered up and tested.</description>

      <description>After years of using pad/prototyping boards to build my computer I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to switch things up a bit and have a go at making a custom PCB.</description>

      <description>In my last three posts I covered the design of the auxiliary control unit which will ease entering and inspecting programs in the computer’s memory. With the design ‘in the bag’ it’s time to get constructing although this time we’re not starting with a blank card …</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re getting nearer and nearer to a computer that can run though a program in memory rather than just a single instruction &amp;hellip; we&amp;rsquo;ve got memory to hold the program and a program counter to point to the current instruction in memory.</description>

      <description>In my last post I made a start on the memory unit construction with the lower memory card. The lower card centres around the memory IC which runs at 5V.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to make a start on the construction of the memory unit and as mentioned in my last post this one is a bit more complex than &amp;lsquo;boring old registers&amp;rsquo; and so I&amp;rsquo;ll split it over two posts.</description>

      <description>Having somehow forgotten to take time off work I&amp;rsquo;m now playing &amp;lsquo;annual leave catch up&amp;rsquo; which means lots of four day weeks but also, and more importantly for this blog, I&amp;rsquo;m getting time to crack on with construction of my relay computer.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve nearly got the design for the memory cards done and ready to share but once that&amp;rsquo;s out the way it&amp;rsquo;ll be time to get on with some construction again.</description>

      <description>Before I can test the new decoder, sequencer and controller cards all working together with the rest of the computer I need to construct the &amp;lsquo;W&amp;rsquo; backplane which the new cards sit on.</description>

      <description>So yea, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last post &amp;hellip; in fact it&amp;rsquo;s been just over six months. For some reason I decided I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough to do in the evenings so had a crack at becoming an actuary.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m just about at the half way mark now for getting the computer to operate the MOV8, ALU and SETAB instructions. The easier cards are out of the way now &amp;hellip; time for the slightly more complex ones.</description>

      <description>In a change from prior form I&amp;rsquo;m combining the construction and testing of the next card in to a single post this time. Partly because this card is a nice easy one but also because it&amp;rsquo;s the first card that I&amp;rsquo;ll be partially constructing to begin with and then I&amp;rsquo;ll return to it later to add further functionality.</description>

      <description>In my last post I mentioned I&amp;rsquo;d suffered a bit of a set back with the construction of the ALU backplane. Well, the short version of things is that I&amp;rsquo;ve admitted defeat and constructed a new backplane using a different design &amp;hellip; it looks like this:</description>

      <description>So, as mentioned in my last post this time I&amp;rsquo;ve put in the wire links and wraps needed to test the first bit of the arithmetic card.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s always a fiddly job getting the relay sockets soldered in and the ALU arithmetic card proved no exception. With this in mind I&amp;rsquo;ve been spreading the work out over several mini sessions in accordance with my new post-Xmas lack of patience.</description>

      <description>Following on from the successful construction of the ALU logic card in my last post it&amp;rsquo;s time to start off the new year with the next ALU card (number 2 of 3 ALU cards in total) &amp;hellip; the arithmetic card.</description>

      <description>The ALU logic card is now finally complete! &amp;hellip; well, it is now I&amp;rsquo;ve popped the last few relays into their sockets. The final card looks like this:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m now just one session of wire wrapping away from a completed ALU logic card. The final job is to wire up the gating relays that select one of the five logic results back on to the data bus.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s now enough sockets, solder and wires to test all eight bits of the ALU logic card. This isn&amp;rsquo;t quite a full test as the gating relays that apply one of the results produced by each bit unit haven&amp;rsquo;t been wired up yet but there&amp;rsquo;s enough there to be able to set an input and see the results displayed on the LEDs along the front of the card.</description>

      <description>It seems that every time I move on to the next stage of construction on the ALU logic card it&amp;rsquo;s fiddlier than the stage before it &amp;hellip; this stage is no exception.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just realised that as I&amp;rsquo;ve been constructing the first ALU card I&amp;rsquo;ve not given much thought to how I&amp;rsquo;ll actually test the card (or other cards for that matter) when complete &amp;hellip; this post therefore represents a quick aside to tackle testing.</description>

      <description>The construction of the ALU logic card is coming along nicely but there&amp;rsquo;s still a lot of soldering ahead to get all the relay sockets down &amp;hellip; and this part is the fiddliest bit yet.</description>

      <description>Following on from the successful construction of the first bit on the ALU logic card in my last post it&amp;rsquo;s now time to start putting together the other 7 bits and the gating circuits (to place one of the logic results on to the data bus).</description>

      <description>So, although I probably should construct the logic card methodically a full stage at a time (solder header pins then sockets then wire wrap) I can&amp;rsquo;t resist fully assembling a single bit alone to see if/how it works.</description>

      <description>Before I can test all of the LEDs laid down so far (to make sure they survived the heat of the soldering iron) I need to add some wire links on the logic card between the LED anodes and the header pins.</description>

      <description>So far, in the construction of the three ALU cards (Logic, Arithmetic and Control) I&amp;rsquo;ve soldered down the connectors and LEDs. It&amp;rsquo;s now time to solder in some header pins and join them to the existing connectors and LEDs ready for wire-wrapping later.</description>
