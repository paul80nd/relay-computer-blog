      <description>In my last three posts I covered the design of the auxiliary control unit which will ease entering and inspecting programs in the computer’s memory. With the design ‘in the bag’ it’s time to get constructing although this time we’re not starting with a blank card …</description>

      <description>In my last post I made a start on the auxiliary control design which once completed will make it much easier to load instructions in to memory - effectively it&amp;rsquo;s a computer within a computer.</description>

      <description>My relay computer is now at the point where it can execute a program in memory without assistance. In order to do that though, of course, the program needs to be loaded into memory in the first place and at the moment that&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a pain.</description>

      <description>Well, the good news is I&amp;rsquo;ve just passed a major milestone in constructing this relay computer &amp;hellip; it can now perform a single instruction in full firing the various control lines as needed.</description>

      <description>Over my last seven posts I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly putting together the card designs so that the computer will be able to operate the MOV-8, ALU and SETAB instructions.</description>

      <description>Now that the two display cards are complete enough to display and control the status of the ALU and four registers (A-D) it&amp;rsquo;s time to fit them to the upper enclosure.</description>

      <description>In my last post I put together the beginnings of the first display card &amp;hellip; named in a brilliant flash of nomenclature as display card A.</description>

      <description>Following on from working on the main data switches in my last post this time I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the first steps in designing and constructing the first of two display cards which will sit in the upper enclosure.</description>

      <description>Now I&amp;rsquo;ve got a fully working ALU and four registers completed I want to take a short break from card building and turn my attention to making it easier to interact with the computer.</description>
