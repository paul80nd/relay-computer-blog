      <description>As the clock struck midnight at the very end of 2019 I decided, over a glass of something sparkling, that I&amp;rsquo;d set myself a challenge to put out a series of six YouTube videos within the space of one month.</description>

      <description>In my last post I covered off the full design for the decoder card so all that remains is to get it soldered up and tested.</description>

      <description>In my last couple of posts I covered off the full design for the sequencer unit. With PCBs now safely arrived in the post I can get on with soldering up the cards and giving them a test.</description>

      <description>This is a bit of a landmark moment &amp;hellip; at least for the construction of my relay computer. For a long time now my blog posts have been leading up to the point where my computer will execute a program in memory without any further input from the user.</description>

      <description>In my last two posts I covered the construction of the upper and lower incrementer cards. The lower card is a 16-bit half adder and the upper card is a 16-bit register.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve covered the construction of the upper and lower memory cards in my last two posts &amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s now time to bring those two cards together to form the memory unit proper and give it all a test.</description>

      <description>In my last couple of posts I&amp;rsquo;ve been slightly distracted by some &amp;lsquo;miscellany&amp;rsquo; but now I return to form and crack on with constructing the program counter.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s finally time to give all the cards created so far a test so I can check everything works together as expected. This represents quite a bit of a milestone as the computer can now perform a single ALU, SETAB or MOV-8 instruction.</description>

      <description>In a change from prior form I&amp;rsquo;m combining the construction and testing of the next card in to a single post this time. Partly because this card is a nice easy one but also because it&amp;rsquo;s the first card that I&amp;rsquo;ll be partially constructing to begin with and then I&amp;rsquo;ll return to it later to add further functionality.</description>

      <description>The A/D Register card is now complete and looks like this:
{% figure %} {% endfigure %}
As usual I&amp;rsquo;ve put a video together that demonstrates this card in operation.</description>

      <description>The B/C Register card is now complete and looks like this:
{% figure %} {% endfigure %}
As usual I&amp;rsquo;ve put a video together which demonstrates this card in operation &amp;hellip; firstly on its own but then together with all the other cards constructed so far.</description>

      <description>Following my last post on the completed backplane I&amp;rsquo;m now in a position to connect all the other completed cards together to test the full ALU.</description>

      <title>ALU Construction: Completed Backplane</title>

      <description>In my last post I mentioned I&amp;rsquo;d suffered a bit of a set back with the construction of the ALU backplane. Well, the short version of things is that I&amp;rsquo;ve admitted defeat and constructed a new backplane using a different design &amp;hellip; it looks like this:</description>

      <title>ALU Construction: Completed Control Card Full Test</title>
      <link>https://relaycomputer.co.uk/2014/03/alu-construction-completed-control-card.html</link>

      <description>The ALU Control Card is now complete and looks like this:
{% figure %}{% endfigure %}
This card was, on the whole, much simpler and quicker to put together than previous cards (despite me initially messing up the zero detection relay positions).</description>

      <description>The ALU arithmetic card is now complete! The final card looks like this:
{% figure %} {% endfigure %}
As I did for the ALU logic card before I&amp;rsquo;ve put the following YouTube video together which gives a walkthrough of the arithmetic card in operation &amp;hellip; and as before this one also has a narrative track delivered by my own fair gob.</description>

      <description>The ALU logic card is now finally complete! &amp;hellip; well, it is now I&amp;rsquo;ve popped the last few relays into their sockets. The final card looks like this:</description>
