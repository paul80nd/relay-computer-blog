      <description>Having somehow forgotten to take time off work I&amp;rsquo;m now playing &amp;lsquo;annual leave catch up&amp;rsquo; which means lots of four day weeks but also, and more importantly for this blog, I&amp;rsquo;m getting time to crack on with construction of my relay computer. The current milestone I&amp;rsquo;m working towards is finishing off the Program Counter, Incrementer and Memory cards (which are all well under way now) so that I can load a simple program in to the computer and set it running without any further intervention.
