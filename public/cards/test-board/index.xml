      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just realised that as I&amp;rsquo;ve been constructing the first ALU card I&amp;rsquo;ve not given much thought to how I&amp;rsquo;ll actually test the card (or other cards for that matter) when complete &amp;hellip; this post therefore represents a quick aside to tackle testing.
What I&amp;rsquo;m looking for is a small board with enough switches on it to drive the various inputs of each card &amp;hellip; ideally it&amp;rsquo;ll be reusable between cards and easy to use.</description>
