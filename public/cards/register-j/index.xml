      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for the oddly therapeutic part of designing a PCB &amp;hellip; laying out the board. In my last post I covered the schematic design and so we now have all the components required for a 16-bit register captured in my design program of choice (EasyEDA) along with how each component is connected to everything else. The next step is to generate a PCB layout from that schematic &amp;hellip; and I say &amp;lsquo;generate&amp;rsquo; which perhaps makes it sound like it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;lsquo;click of a button&amp;rsquo; type thing &amp;hellip; well, clicking the &amp;lsquo;create PCB&amp;rsquo; button results in this:</description>

      <description>In my last couple of posts I&amp;rsquo;ve been building up to a change of approach in how I&amp;rsquo;m making the cards in my computer. This is mainly because I can&amp;rsquo;t face the monotony of hand building the upcoming register cards (which I&amp;rsquo;ll need three of so it&amp;rsquo;s triple the procrastination holding me back). The obvious solution to all of this is to create a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) which will cut out most of the trickier soldering and pretty much all the repetitive wirewrap &amp;hellip; and that looked like the way to go until I had a go at hand crafting a simplified PCB for the Y backplane and I realised it&amp;rsquo;s not as easy as it might otherwise appear.</description>
