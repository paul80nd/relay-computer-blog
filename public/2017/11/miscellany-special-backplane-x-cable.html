      <p>Continuing on with the theme from my last post … here is another 
‘miscellany special’ covering all the little ‘side jobs’ I’ve been doing on my 
relay computer alongside the primary work of constructing the Program Counter, 
Memory and Incrementer cards. There’s three things worth covering (plus an 
additional minor mention) … let’s start with backplanes.</p>

<p>The 
computer is designed with four backplanes (W, X, Y and Z) each taking five 
cards. Each card of the computer is designed to fit in a specific backplane as 
each backplane offers a unique selection of busses and connections. Generally 
you can put a card designated for a given backplane in to any of the five 
backplane slots (position mainly being an aesthetic thing) however the W 
backplane is the notable exception having slots W1 - W2 - W1 - W2 - W1 taking 
two double cards (with W1 and W2 connectors) and one single card (W1 
connectors).</p>

<p>Anyhoo, the computer might well be designed to have 
four backplanes but currently it’s only got two constructed (W and Z). The 
instruction register card is type X but as it’s on its own at the moment the 
busses are plugged directly in to the card. This soon becomes unworkable 
however when the Program Counter and Incremeter are built as they are also 
type X cards … plus the Incrementer is built over two cards so we’re looking 
at an additional three type X cards. Time to build another backplane:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2017/2017-11-05-0000.jpg" alt="X Backplane (front)" />
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2017/2017-11-05-0001.jpg" alt="X Backplane (back)" />
  
</figure>

<p>There’s nothing 
particularly unusual about this backplane compared to the two already 
constructed although those of you out there with a good eye for detail (for 
whom my work must eternally frustrate) will notice this backplane has a dirty 
great capacitor stuck across the power rails. This is something that should 
have been on the other backplanes (and will be added later) to smooth out the 
power supply. With so many relays switching on and off there is a danger of 
the power supply getting really noisy which the relays themselves can likely 
tolerate but the memory chip or similar wouldn’t be pleased at all. In this 
case ‘dirty great’ is defined as 4700uF. Given there’ll be four of these it’ll 
have a slightly odd effect on the computer when turning it off at the mains 
… the computer will keep going for a couple of seconds as it drains the 
reserve in the capacitors then when the voltage dips below the relay release 
limit any relays that are on will start dropping out. It’s an interesting 
effect and you’ll be able to see it in my next demo video.</p>

<p>These 
backplanes are fairly repetitive to build and fortunately there’s only one 
more to go after this one … the Y backplane. Unfortunately the Memory cards 
are type ‘Y’ … and yep, that’s cards plural again as the Memory unit is 
spread over two cards … so it won’t be long before I’ll be building the 
fourth and final backplane. If for any reason I did have to rebuild any of 
these backplanes I think this is the point where I’d switch to etching PCBs 
… something I considered for the cards of the computer in general rather 
than wire wrap. It’d certainly be quicker but is harder to change if there’s a 
design fault somewhere. The worry with the backplane is that there’s lots of 
connecting parts so there’s many more places faults could happen and I have 
had issues in the past with the ribbon cable sockets not making a sound 
electrical connection with the sockets on the board. Anyway, musing aside, 
here’s how the backplanes look in the computer viewed from the front:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2017/2017-11-05-0002.jpg" alt="Backplanes W, X and Z viewed from the front" />
  
</figure>

<p>If 
you click the picture for the slightly larger version you can see I’ve had my 
little white pen out again and I’ve marked up the connectors at the left and 
right of the backplanes to make it easier when identifying which ribbon cables 
go where. Speaking of which, that brings me nicely on to the second subject - 
ribbon cable routing.</p>

<p>With the three backplanes in place I’m now at 
the point where everything that’ll need the X and Z control busses exists and 
is sat in its final resting place in the computer. If you’ve seen my last 
overview video you’d have noticed that generally the cables running through 
the back of the computer can only really be described as ‘an awful mess’. It’s 
time to do something about that:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2017/2017-11-05-0003.jpg" alt="Cable routing for X and Z busses" />
  
</figure>

<p>For the X and 
Z busses I’ve neatly routed, folded and labeled the cables and also put some 
cable tie restraints together to keep them in place. I’ll continue this way of 
routing the cables as busses become more permanent. Note therefore that in the 
case of the D/C bus (which comes off the Z backplane at the bottom right) it 
loosely weaves its way up past the W backplane … eventually this will be 
nicely routed and labeled.</p>

<p>The three control busses (X, Y and Z) 
all head up to the upper enclosure via the left hand slot. It’s quite hard to 
see in the picture but the Z bus goes up behind the X cable having visited the 
W backplane on its journey from the Z backplane. When the Y backplane is added 
the Y control bus will similarly visit the W backplane on it’s journey to the 
upper enclosure and also leave via the left hand slot. The D/C, C/I and D/I 
busses go up to the upper enclosure via the right hand slot. Again, as these 
aren’t permanently routed at the moment it’s a bit messy. Speaking of which, 
there’s the usual mess of connectors in the upper display for the D/C/I 
busses:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2017/2017-11-05-0004.jpg" alt="Mess of wires and connectors for the D, C and I busses" />
  
</figure>

<p>The mess of cables and connectors is due to needing to connect the 
C’s, D’s and I’s together of the D/C, C/I and D/I busses. All three busses 
come up from the lower enclosure but only two go off to the upper enclosure 
cards (D/C and C/I). Later on I’ll create a small ‘break out card’ where each 
bus can plug in to and each line of each bus will be wired out. This should 
massively neaten things up in this area. Eventually there’ll be another 
perspex/acrylic panel where the cables are currently spilling out and not only 
will this be where the mains cable will plug in but also all of those busses 
that have come in to the upper enclosure will also be exposed via sockets so 
that it’s possible to plug in extensions and add-ons to the computer.</p>

<p>While we’re in the upper enclosure I’ll quickly cover some minor 
fittings/fixtures changes:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2017/2017-11-05-0005.jpg" alt="Close up of securing brackets" />
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2017/2017-11-05-0006.jpg" alt="Close up of card brackets" />
  
</figure>

<p>As the computer is 
getting heavier and heavier I’ve decided to securely fasten the upper 
enclosure to the lower. Originally I wanted to have it so that the two halves 
could be split to make carrying around easier but it really complicated the 
busses as I’d have to have some quick way of disconnecting them. In the end I 
just gave up and bolted the two halves together. There’s four of these 
brackets, one in each corner, and they’re very strong but also electrically 
conductive which means the whole case goes back to the power supply earth just 
in case something nasty were to happen. Whilst I was fixing things to other 
things I also put some brackets in to sit the upper cards on. These were 
previously floating around inside the case so this is a much better 
alternative. The cards are only secured at one side due to the holes in the 
right hand brackets not quite lining up. Gravity works in my favour on this 
one so the brackets are effectively just taking some of the weight.</p>

<p>Right, last subject … the address bus. With the new type ‘X’ cards I’ll be 
creating it’s now time to implement the address bus. As far as the backplanes 
are concerned that’s an easy one - just a 16 way ribbon cable - but it’s at 
the upper enclosure where a little more work is required. Firstly I need to be 
able to gate the front primary switches to the address bus. That’s just a hand 
full of relays and a new Sel-AS button so that the front panel now looks like 
this:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2017/2017-11-05-0007.jpg" alt="Display A with added Sel-AS button" />
  
</figure>

<p>Whilst I 
was at it I also soldered down all the remaining switches (to avoid repeatedly 
taking the display A card out of the enclosure) and popped on the ld-PC and 
sel-PC caps which will be used for the upcoming Program Counter. Next up, I 
needed to add a display for the value on the address bus:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2017/2017-11-05-0008.jpg" alt="Display B with added Address Bus" />
  
</figure>

<p>Here I’ve 
added the 16 LED bars to show the address bus contents just above the data bus 
display. Again, to avoid taking the card in and out of the enclosure, I’ve 
added all remaining display units. Effectively that completes Display B so 
what you see above is the final version of that card. Last job for the address 
bus is to wire it out on the display distribution card:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2017/2017-11-05-0009.jpg" alt="Display Distribution Card (front)" />
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2017/2017-11-05-0010.jpg" alt="Display Distribution Card (rear)" />
  
</figure>

<p>Nothing too 
unusual here - just more of the same - although one thing of note is that I’ve 
started making little cable ties out of Kynar wire to bunch groups of wires 
together. I quite like the way this looks so expect to see them more often in 
future cards.</p>

<p>Right then, that’s enough for this post and for my 
duo of ‘miscellany specials’. The next post will, finally, get on with the job 
of constructing the Program Counter and giving it a test (both on its own and 
inside the computer as a whole). After that there’s the Memory and 
Incrementers cards and then we’re getting close to having a computer that can 
run a simple program.</p>
