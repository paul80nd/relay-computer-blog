      <p>I’ve nearly got the design for the memory cards done and ready to share but 
once that’s out the way it’ll be time to get on with some construction again. 
With that in mind I cracked out the credit cards and got buying more relays 
plus some other bits and bobs and whilst I was in a spending mood I decided it 
was high time to treat the computer to some more laser cut parts.</p>

<p>The two displays (A and B) in the upper enclosure have been looking a bit 
‘unfinished’ and it was always my intention to get some laser cut panels made 
up eventually which would surround the switches and LEDs and give it a more 
‘polished’ look. Additionally the panels would also carry an engraved legend 
to explain what each group of switches/LEDs represents in the displays. The 
process for making these is just the same as before when I got the laser cut 
panel for the primary switches.</p>

<p>As before I’ve chosen to get my 
laser cutting done through <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.razorlab.co.uk/">RazorLab</a> who provide starter templates for Adobe 
Illustrator, InkScape and Corel Draw … in my case, being as I’m a 
cheapskate, I’ve gone with the open source InkScape application. Regardless of 
the application you end up using though the process is pretty much identical. 
The laser will cut the material wherever you place a blue line. If you want to 
engrave the material you use a magenta, green or red line to get a light, 
medium or heavy line accordingly. Finally if you want to have a ‘raster 
engraved’ area you fill a shape with grey … the darker the shade the 
deeper/heavier the engraving. For the text you just type it up as normal with 
the font size and face of your choice and then convert it to paths so that 
it’s just a collection of lines and curves like anything else … needless to 
say that before you convert the text you should do a spell check.</p>

<p>The key thing with finalising a design for laser cutting is to prototype in 
paper first … keep trying it … refine the design and try it again. Keep 
going round in this loop until your design is perfect as once it’s been sent 
off to be cut there’s no going back. Here’s a picture of Display A with the 
paper prototype panel in place:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2017/2017-08-06-0000.jpg" alt="Display A Panel Paper Prototype" />
  
</figure>

<p>… and here is the design itself (in which 
I’ve thickened up all the cutting lines to 0.5mm so it’s easier to see them 
whereas in the original file that goes over to RazorLab the lines must be 
0.01mm):</p>

  <figcaption>Cutting File (<a href="/assets/img/posts/2017/2017-08-06-1001.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So then, you upload the files to RazorLab, choose your 
material, cross their palms with silver and then you wait for a knock on the 
door from Royal Mail (if you live in the UK that is). Actually this time 
around RazorLab turned the order around in three days which is pretty 
impressive. I think last time it took a couple of weeks so not sure if I’ve 
just caught them at a quieter time or if they’ve got more machines spreading 
the workload. When that parcel does arrive you get to experience that 
magic/frantic moment where you open it up and get confirmation if your design 
was right, if your material choice was the right one and if it made it through 
the post in one piece. To capture that ‘special’ moment I’ve put together a 
video which also shows what I do with the panels afterwards:</p>

<figure class="image is-16by9">
    <iframe class="has-ratio" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nymZrhuwn8Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</figure>

<p>That’s it for this post … hopefully the video has 
given you a bit of an insight to making laser cut parts (it’s the sort of 
thing you really need to see rather than read about I think). In my next post 
I’ll cover the design of the memory cards (yup, I know I said that last time 
too). In the meanwhile I’ve treated myself to a couple of days off work. The 
first half of day 1 you’ve seen in the video above but in the second half I 
soldered the LEDs down on the program counter, incrementer and memory cards. 
In my second day off I’ll carry on constructing those cards and I’ll share 
some pictures and details about that in a future post.</p>
