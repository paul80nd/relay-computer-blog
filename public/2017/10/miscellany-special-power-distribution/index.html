          <p>Having somehow forgotten to take time off work I&rsquo;m now playing &lsquo;annual leave
catch up&rsquo; which means lots of four day weeks but also, and more importantly
for this blog, I&rsquo;m getting time to crack on with construction of my relay
computer. The current milestone I&rsquo;m working towards is finishing off the
Program Counter, Incrementer and Memory cards (which are all well under way
now) so that I can load a simple program in to the computer and set it running
without any further intervention.</p>
<p>Now, if there&rsquo;s
one weak spot I possess (one of many I&rsquo;m sure) it&rsquo;s a short attention span.
There&rsquo;s a certain amount of repetitiveness in wire wrapping &lsquo;register based&rsquo;
cards like the Program Counter and Incrementer so it&rsquo;s always tempting to
indulge in a little variety and pick off all those &lsquo;little jobs&rsquo; that need
doing on the computer. This post (and the one coming after it) sweeps up all
those little changes that have been happening lately and attempts to record
them before they get forgotten.</p>
<p>First up, lets talk
about power. So far I&rsquo;ve been running the computer off my bench power supply
but the intention was always that the computer would eventually have a power
supply of its very own. I did, momentarily, consider building my own power
supply but decided I didn&rsquo;t want my house burning down so I opted for an off
the shelf job. A quick browse of Amazon led to a knock at my door the
following day with a parcel
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01DDIHKPI">containing this</a>. Here&rsquo;s some pictures of said power supply
fitted to the computer:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2017/2017-10-29-0000.jpg" alt="Power supply fitted to computer (front)">
<img src="/img/posts/2017/2017-10-29-0001.jpg" alt="Power supply fitted to computer (back)">
  
</figure>

<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of choice with power supplies but I needed
something that was going to fit in the computer case, run at 12V but also
supply enough current. Enough current? Working out how much is enough has
involved a fair bit of guesswork, fortune telling but mainly basic arithmetic.
The power is distributed to the four backplanes plus display through five 2A
fuses. This gives the power supply some additional short/overload protection
but also limits how much current goes through the power wiring. All power
cables from the fuses onwards are rated above 2A but of course the power
doesn&rsquo;t stop there - it goes in to any number of relays and then fans out from
there. Example calculations coming up next but let&rsquo;s take another quick
picture break &hellip; here&rsquo;s the power distribution board with those 2A
fuses:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2017/2017-10-29-0002.jpg" alt="Power distribution board">
  
</figure>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s take
an example. Looking at the
<a href="http://www.te.com/commerce/DocumentDelivery/DDEController?Action=showdoc&amp;DocId=Specification+Or+Standard%7F108-98002%7FW%7Fpdf%7FEnglish%7FENG_SS_108-98002_W_P2.pdf%7F5-1393788-8">relay data sheet</a>
the coil in each individual relay has a
resistance of 1029 ohms so when pushing 12V it should consume 0.01166180758
amps (via <a href="http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/dccircuits/dcp_2.html">ohms law</a> of I = V / R)
which is 11.66mA. Using
the power triangle where P = I x V the coil should therefore
use 0.139941691 watts of power when energised which is 139.94mW which is
pretty much the 140mW stated in the data sheet. Let&rsquo;s look at one of the
&lsquo;hungrier&rsquo; cards - the Program Counter. This card is effectively a 16bit
register so in a case where all bits are set that&rsquo;s 16 relays on at the same
time for a total of 199mA. The card doesn&rsquo;t just consist of relays though &hellip;
there&rsquo;s the LEDs to consider too. Each LED consumes around 10mA so that&rsquo;s
another 160mA to the pile giving a running total of 359mA which is
0.36A.</p>
<p>OK, so let&rsquo;s assume each backplane has
five of these &lsquo;hungry&rsquo; cards mentioned above. That&rsquo;d give us a total of 1.8A
per backplane which is still comfortably within the 2A limit the fuses impose.
In practice I&rsquo;ve rarely seen the consumption for the whole computer as it
stands go above 2A but it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ll need to always keep an eye on &hellip;
or at the very least the fuses will tell me if we&rsquo;ve got too greedy for power.
The power per backplane can, of course, be calculated if you follow every
route the power goes but let&rsquo;s not &hellip; let&rsquo;s assume 2A should be
enough.</p>
<p>So, with five power lines taking up to 2A
each we&rsquo;re assuming a potential 10A total. Power wise that&rsquo;s 120W &hellip; slightly
more than those 100W light bulbs that you can&rsquo;t buy any more. That doesn&rsquo;t
sound all that bad until you look at it another way &hellip; if you took a modern
LED GU10 bulb at, say, 4W you could run 30 of them (perhaps two houses worth)
or you could run my computer at full pelt (assuming it&rsquo;d ever get anywhere
near 10A of course). Let&rsquo;s assume it will hit 10A &hellip; I now need to get that
much electricity from the power supply to the distribution board &hellip; enter the
power loom:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2017/2017-10-29-0003.jpg" alt="Power distribution board with power supply loom">
  
</figure>

<p>The wire I&rsquo;m using for power distribution is stranded
16/0.2mm which is rated at 3A therefore can comfortably handle the maximum 2A
that&rsquo;ll go through each fuse. To supply the fuses I&rsquo;ve used five lengths of
this wire and then grouped them all together at the ammeter. The meter itself
reads up to 10A so should be happy having that much flowing through it (you&rsquo;d
hope). The final part then is to wire up to the outputs of the power supply.
There are two outputs each capable of delivering half the total 15A so using
55/0.1mm &lsquo;flexi&rsquo; cables which are happy to carry 6A then we&rsquo;ve split the 10A
over two of these cables for a potential 5A per cable. With this arrangement
everything has a little extra &lsquo;wiggle room&rsquo; and is comfortably within
tolerances. Here&rsquo;s a close up of the ammeter with the incoming power lines and
the wiring loom heading off to the distribution board:</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>Looking at the picture above there&rsquo;s an additional card
(hanging at a jaunty angle) that you might not have seen before. This is the
auxiliary clock which outputs a timing signal at varying frequencies. This
replaces the temporary 555 timer I had on a breadboard but it&rsquo;s worthy of its
very own blog post so I&rsquo;ll cover that in an upcoming episode. Speaking of
which, lets leave this post there for now but in my next post I&rsquo;ll continue
sweeping up some of the miscellany before getting back on to the main job of
constructing cards.</p>
