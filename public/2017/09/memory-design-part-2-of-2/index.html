          <p>In my last post I started the design for the computer&rsquo;s memory unit
which is spread over two cards. With the lower memory card design in place its
now time to finish the job and design the upper card which will interface the
rest of the computer with the memory chip of the lower card.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s
dive straight in by bringing up the board interconnects from the lower
card:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2017/2017-09-06-0000.png" alt="Memory Card A with initial interconnects">
  
  <figcaption markdown="span">Memory Card A with initial interconnects (<a href="/img/posts/2017/2017-09-06-1000.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>The
left two columns bring up the address bus for the memory chip which needs to
be at 5V for a logic 1 and at ground for a logic 0. The third column brings up
the outbound data bus which will sink 12V to ground for a logic 1 but holds at
12V for a logic 0 (effectively an inverse of what you&rsquo;d expect). The fourth
column brings up the inbound data bus which takes 5V for 1 and ground for 0
along with the write enable (WE) control line and output enable (OE) line
which work in reverse (5V for disabled and ground for enabled). The last three
connects to the right are power at 12V, ground for 5V and finally 5V. As you
can probably guess there&rsquo;s going to need to be quite a lot of &lsquo;translation&rsquo;
logic on this card.</p>
<p>First &lsquo;translation&rsquo; job is to take the computer
data bus, which is 12V for a logic 1 and disconnected for a 0, and wire that
out to 5V for 1 and ground for 0. That&rsquo;s not overly complicated and looks like
this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2017/2017-09-06-0001.png" alt="Memory Card A with added data bus in translation relays">
  
  <figcaption markdown="span">Memory Card A with added data bus in translation relays (<a href="/img/posts/2017/2017-09-06-1001.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>Note that although we now have the data bus converted to something
suitable for the memory chip we need to be able to gate this so it&rsquo;s only
connected when we&rsquo;re storing a value to memory. This is because when we&rsquo;re
reading a value it comes back in through the outbound data bus interconnects.
With the additional gating added the card looks like this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2017/2017-09-06-0002.png" alt="Memory Card A with added data bus in gating">
  
  <figcaption markdown="span">Memory Card A with added data bus in gating (<a href="/img/posts/2017/2017-09-06-1002.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>The line that controls the gating of the inbound data bus is named
&lsquo;B2M&rsquo; which stands for &lsquo;Bus To Memory&rsquo; (because that&rsquo;s what it does). There&rsquo;s
a &lsquo;veto&rsquo; relay on the control line which will be used later on to override the
B2M line when required.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s turn now to the data bus feed coming
back from the memory chip which will also need gating so that it only
influences the data bus of the computer when needed:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2017/2017-09-06-0003.png" alt="Memory Card A with added data bus out gating">
  
  <figcaption markdown="span">Memory Card A with added data bus out gating (<a href="/img/posts/2017/2017-09-06-1003.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>The memory read (MR) line controls these particular gating relays
but also the B2M &lsquo;veto&rsquo; relay to ensure that if we&rsquo;re reading a value from the
memory chip we can&rsquo;t be loading it at the same time. Without this we could
have odd situations where a 5V coming off the memory chip is shorted to ground
on the input bus.</p>
<p>To get the memory value all the way out to the
computer data bus there&rsquo;s a bit more translation required. In this case if the
memory chip is putting out 5V on a line the relay driver will sink 12V to
ground whereas if the memory chip is at ground on a line the relay driver will
hold at 12V (logically inverted). To make this work this is the only place in
the computer where we play with the &lsquo;other&rsquo; side of the relay coil (which is
usually soldered to ground):</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2017/2017-09-06-0004.png" alt="Memory Card A with added data bus out translation relays">
  
  <figcaption markdown="span">Memory Card A with added data bus out translation relays (<a href="/img/posts/2017/2017-09-06-1004.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>On the positive side of the relay coils we extend the MR control
line so that the relays only operate whilst MR is held high. The negative side
of the relay coils are connected, via the gating relays, to the relay driver
on the lower memory card. Therefore, it takes the MR line to be high and the
data bus line to be sinking to ground for the relay to switch on. Whilst the
relay is switched on it&rsquo;ll gate the MR line to the appropriate bit of the data
bus creating the end result that we&rsquo;re after.</p>
<p>The final part of the
data bus &lsquo;picture&rsquo; is to operate the write enable (WE) and output enable (OE)
lines of the memory chip which as mentioned earlier operate in reverse of what
you&rsquo;d expect: 5V to disable and ground to enable. Only one additional relay is
required:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2017/2017-09-06-0005.png" alt="Memory Card A with added control relay">
  
  <figcaption markdown="span">Memory Card A with added control relay (<a href="/img/posts/2017/2017-09-06-1005.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>The OE line is grounded whilst the memory read (MR)
line is high but disconnected otherwise. That&rsquo;s fine in this case as the line
is pulled to high via a resistor on the lower memory card. In other words the
output is disabled by default until requested by the MR line. There&rsquo;s an
additional control line introduced above which is the memory write (MW) line.
The MW line pulls the write enable (WE) line low when MW is high. Again the WE
line is pulled to high via a resistor on the lower memory cards and again the
WE is disabled by default until requested by the MW line.</p>
<p>That
completes the data bus wiring but seems a shame not to fill the remaining
space of the card with yet more relays so let&rsquo;s go for that:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2017/2017-09-06-0006.png" alt="Memory Card A with added address bus translation relays">
  
  <figcaption markdown="span">Memory Card A with added address bus translation relays (<a href="/img/posts/2017/2017-09-06-1006.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>The final relays above translate the incoming address bus, at 12V
for 1 and disconnected for 0, to the required 5V for 1 or ground for 0. In
this case no gating is required as it&rsquo;s no problem having the memory card
always reacting to the current value on the address bus &hellip; well, except for
the extra power consumption of firing relays unnecessarily perhaps. Notice
that there&rsquo;s only 15 address bus relays even though, of course, there&rsquo;s 16
lines on the address bus. As mentioned in the last post we&rsquo;re dealing with a
32K memory chip and therefore only use half the addressable space which leaves
room for future expansion in the upper addressable space.</p>
<p>So,
that&rsquo;s ended up as one of the &lsquo;busier&rsquo; card designs in the computer and it&rsquo;s
one where I&rsquo;ll need to be careful with the wiring when constructing.
Nonetheless that&rsquo;s the memory unit design complete and ready to go and as
always you can find a version <a href="/pdf/memory.pdf">here in PDF format</a>.</p>
<p>With the memory card,
program counter and incrementer design in the bag we&rsquo;re very close to having a
computer that can run a program in memory. In the next post I&rsquo;ll cover the
final piece of the puzzle which is to update the controller card to
orchestrate using these three units together.</p>
