      <p>It’s been a while since my last post … pretty much 10 months in fact … and 
I’d love to say I’ve been quietly working on my relay computer in the meantime 
but I haven’t. Designing, building and blogging about the various parts of the 
computer is really time consuming and unfortunately I’m just one of those 
people who has way too many hobbies. Anyway, after picking up some subscribers 
on YouTube I thought it was high time (or maybe I felt guilty enough) to focus 
back on the computer and get it through to the next milestone … where it can 
step through a simple program stored in its memory without any human 
intervention (beyond entering the program itself and setting the computer 
running).</p>

<p>So where to begin? The three units that’ll need building 
are the program counter, incrementer and memory. To recap: the memory holds 
the instructions that make up the program to be executed; the program counter 
points to the current instruction (line of program) in the memory; and the 
incrementer adds one to the program counter to move it on to the next 
instruction. Using those three units you can step through the program in 
memory and for each instruction load it in to the instruction register, move 
the program counter on and then execute that given instruction. The cycle is 
repeated until the end of the program is reached.</p>

<p>I’m going to 
start with the easiest of the three units described above … the program 
counter. Essentially this is just another register card similar the A/D and 
B/C registers created so far. The first difference is that the two 8-bit 
registers on the card are combined to make a single 16-bit register (bits 0-7 
in the first register and bits 8-15 in the second). The second difference is 
that whereas the registers created so far can be loaded and selected on the 
8-bit data bus the program counter is loaded and selected on to the new 16-bit 
address bus. The address bus is generally used to control which slot in the 
memory is required but later on there’ll be some other 16-bit registers which 
can pass values around on the address bus and be used for handling things like 
jumps within a program (for loops and branching based on the ALU condition 
register) and for storing and loading values in memory outside of the program 
code itself.</p>

<p>Given the program counter is very similar to the other 
8-bit registers the schematic doesn’t need much introduction:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2017/2017-05-29-0000.png" alt="Program Counter Schematic" />
  
  <figcaption>Program Counter Schematic (<a href="/assets/img/posts/2017/2017-05-29-1000.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is a type ‘X’ 
card (like the instruction register) and so has the same connectors along the 
back of the card (X control bus, address bus, data/instruction bus and power 
connector). Comparing it with the A/D register the main bit register relays 
are the same but notice that towards the top of the card there’s only one set 
of load/select registers and that’s because both 8-bit registers are 
loaded/selected at the same time. This is also shown down in the LEDs across 
the front of the card … there’s one load LED at the left, one select LED at 
the right and then the 16 LEDs in the middle showing the current 16-bit value 
held in the program counter register as a whole. You can click on the image 
for a closer look but if you want to get in really close you can find a version <a href="/assets/pdf/program-counter.pdf">here in PDF format</a>.</p>

<p>Whilst I’m 
creating the program counter it makes sense to update the two display cards 
and auxiliary control card so that the program counter can be accessed and 
observed when the computer is being operated manually. Let’s start with 
display B on which I’ll add the address bus:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2017/2017-05-29-0001.png" alt="Display B with added Address Bus display" />
  
  <figcaption>Display B with added Address Bus display (<a href="/assets/img/posts/2017/2017-05-29-1001.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The 
address bus consists of red LED light bars similar to the data bus ones but 
with each element half the width to fit the full 16 bits in. As with the 
program counter you can find a <a href="/assets/pdf/display-b-3.pdf">PDF version of the Display B card here</a> and <a href="/assets/pdf/display-b-3a.pdf">another version showing the LED internals here</a>. Next up is 
display A which gains two extra control switches:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2017/2017-05-29-0002.png" alt="Display A with added Program Counter Load/Select" />
  
  <figcaption>Display A with added Program Counter Load/Select (<a href="/assets/img/posts/2017/2017-05-29-1002.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Looking towards the centre of the diagram above you can see the 
new load and select control switches for the program counter (LD PC and SEL 
PC). These allow the user to manually load or select the program counter 
from/to the address bus when required. Again you can find a <a href="/assets/pdf/display-a-3.pdf">PDF version of this diagram here</a> and <a href="/assets/pdf/display-a-3a.pdf">one without the switch caps here</a>.</p>

<p>One thing to 
note in the diagram above is the ‘SEL AS’ switch which was previously wired up 
to the Load Condition Register line (before the LD COND switch was added). 
This now gets to take on its true purpose which is to gate the primary 
switches on to the address bus (in a similar way to how ‘SEL DS’ gates the 
same primary switches on to the data bus). You may have noticed that gives us 
a small problem as the primary switches allow the user to enter an 8-bit value 
but the address bus holds, of course, a 16-bit value. Consequently the ‘SEL 
AS’ switch will only gate to the lower 8-bits of the address bus. There’ll be 
a work around for this later where you could load the upcoming M1 and M2 
registers one at a time which combine to make a full 16-bit M register which 
can then be selected on to the address bus. Typically the primary switches are 
used to load the PC with a starting address for a program and this will 
usually be in the first half of the memory (and even more usually will start 
at the first memory location so that just clearing the PC will give you the 
right starting address). The gating relays for the ‘SEL AS’ functionality can 
be found on the auxiliary control card. The design for this has been done 
previously and the <a href="/assets/pdf/aux-switch-ctrl-2.pdf">PDF version of that can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>Right, 
so that’s pretty much all the design complete for the program counter. The 
only other thing worth noting is that I’ll need to create a type ‘X’ backplane 
as I’ll now have two X cards (the program counter and instruction register). 
This is very similar in design to the ‘Z’ backplane so not really worthy of 
any further detail.</p>

<p>Finally to wrap up this post I’ve updated my 
relay computer simulator which now looks like this:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2017/2017-05-29-0003.png" alt="Screenshot of Relay Computer Simulator" />
  
</figure>

<p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://80nd.co.uk/relaycomputer/">latest version of this can be found here</a> 
(although note that I only ever host the latest version 
so as this post gets older the simulator might be newer than you’d expect). 
Feel free to fire this up and have a play with the program counter. If you’re 
interested in what’s behind the simulator you can see all the 
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/paul80nd/relay-computer">source code on my GitHub page</a>.</p>

<p>Next time I’ll cover the design of the 
incrementer which allows you to add one to the value of the program counter 
effectively moving it on to the next position in memory.</p>
