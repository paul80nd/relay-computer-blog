          <p>So, although I probably should construct the
logic card methodically a full stage at a time (solder header pins then
sockets then wire wrap) I can&rsquo;t resist fully assembling a single bit alone to
see if/how it works. Here of some pictures of that single bit all soldered in
and wired up:</p>

<p>This is the first bit logic unit out of 8 in total and effectively
the pattern is repeated 4 times across the board and for 2 rows up the board.
One thing I was definitely reminded of when putting this first bit together is
how small components on a 0.1 inch pitch actually are and it really is quite
fiddly work. Again, the soldering is a bit grizzly where I&rsquo;ve joined several
pads together and couldn&rsquo;t keep the heat up and solder flowing.</p>
<p>Before powering this new circuitry up I did some spot checking with a
multimeter and straight away found some mis-wired connections &hellip; although
being as I chose to use wire wrap it&rsquo;s trivial to correct mistakes. With
everything then looking good it was time to stick in some relays and apply the
power:</p>

    </figure>
  </div>
  
</div>

<p>All working as expected! This actually
represents a bit of a mini-milestone in the construction and it&rsquo;s really nice
to see something physical emerging from all the drawings and designs. There&rsquo;s
a long way to go to finish this card off (and even further to finish the
computer in general) but seeing some success along the way has given me the
little lift needed to keep me committed to all the soldering and wire wrapping
that&rsquo;s to come.</p>
