          <p>In the last three posts I introduced the
design for the 3-to-8 Function Decoder, Zero Detect circuit and the Condition
Registers. In this post I&rsquo;ll put all three of these components together to
make up the ALU Control Card. So, placing the relays from the three components
onto the card (excluding wire links) we get the following:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2013/2013-12-01-0000.png" alt="ALU Control Card Relays">
  
  <figcaption markdown="span">ALU Control Card Relays (<a href="/img/posts/2013/2013-12-01-1000.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>Unlike the
other cards that make up the full ALU (the logic and arithmetic cards) things
aren&rsquo;t quite so tightly packed in this time. Despite this I&rsquo;ve pushed the
relays out towards the edges of the card to leave room for any future ALU
control expansion or modifications without requiring an extra card. I&rsquo;ll be
displaying the current state of the 3-to-8 Decoder and Condition Registers
with LEDs along the front of the card as with the other cards designed so far.
The LEDs are the same 12V ones as before (to save space that would be used by
the additional resistors) and follow the same colour code of red for results,
yellow for inputs and green for output control signals. Diagram wise the
display looks like this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2013/2013-12-01-0001.png" alt="Result/Control Display LEDs">
  
</figure>

<p>Each block in the diagram
represents the same 3mm LED in a plastic holder as before (with the LED pushed
into the holder from the front and the LED legs bent at 90 degrees). The left
hand LEDs relate to the 3-to-8 Decoder (3-bit function code followed by the
derived 8 control lines) and the right hand ones to the Condition Registers
(Register Load and Enable followed by Sign, Carry and Zero Register
values).</p>
<p>Connector wise things are similar to the Logic and
Arithmetic card: there is the 8-bit data bus, power connections and control
signals but the 8-bit inputs B and C are not required for this card. The
diagram of the connectors look like this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2013/2013-12-01-0002.png" alt="ALU Control Card Connections">
  
</figure>

<p>This shows the three right angled
boxed headers (as per the Logic and Arithmetic card) — from left to right
these are: 8+8 data bus plus control lines, 10+10 control lines and finally
5+5 power lines. Again, some of these connection lines are used by other cards
that share the same ribbon cable / back plane slots but for the sake of
completeness each of the pins are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>D-Bus (Data Bus + Control Lines)
<ul>
<li>D0-D7 &hellip; 8-bit Data Bus</li>
<li>F0-F2 &hellip; ALU Function Code (used by the 3-to-8 Function Decoder on this card)</li>
<li>SN &hellip; Sign Condition Register (produced by this card)</li>
<li>CY &hellip; Carry Condition Register (as above)</li>
<li>EZ &hellip; Zero Condition Register (as above)</li>
<li>NZ &hellip; Non-Zero Condition Register (as above)</li>
<li>CL &hellip; Condition Register Load (as above)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ctrl-Z (Control Line Bus)
<ul>
<li>ADD &hellip; ALU Add Output Enable (produced by this card)</li>
<li>INC &hellip; ALU Increment Output Enable (as above)</li>
<li>AND &hellip; ALU AND Output Enable (as above)</li>
<li>ORR &hellip; ALU OR Output Enable (as above)</li>
<li>XOR &hellip; ALU XOR Output Enable (as above)</li>
<li>NOT &hellip; ALU NOT Output Enable (as above)</li>
<li>SHL &hellip; ALU Shift Left Output Enable (as above)</li>
<li>ICY &hellip; ALU Internal Carry Result (used by this card)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, with everything together including all the
wiring, power supply and ground lines we get the following:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2013/2013-12-01-0003.png" alt="Complete ALU Control Card">
  
  <figcaption markdown="span">Complete ALU Control Card (<a href="/img/posts/2013/2013-12-01-1001.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>As before in
previous posts the completed Arithmetic Control Card design can be found <a href="/pdf/control-unit.pdf">here in PDF format</a> (so you can zoom in for more
detail).</p>
<p>With the three cards that make up the complete ALU all
designed and ready to go I think it&rsquo;s finally time to actually start some
construction and take a break from creating all these diagrams. This will
allow me to actually try out some of the theory and to refine the construction
methods but does carry the risk that I make something that&rsquo;s incompatible with
the rest of the computer design. However, I&rsquo;ve got the registers worked out in
my head and, of course, I&rsquo;m basing my design on the <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/Relay/index.html">Harry Porter Relay Computer</a> so I&rsquo;m confident enough now to get the soldering
iron out.</p>
