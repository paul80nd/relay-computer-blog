          <p>As promised in my last post it&rsquo;s finally time
to get the soldering iron out and make a start on constructing the three cards
that make up the ALU. I&rsquo;m going start by laying down the connectors and LEDs
on each card to make sure I&rsquo;m happy with the look and feel of things and then
I can move on to everything else needed later.</p>
<p>As mentioned in
earlier posts I&rsquo;m basing my construction around 55 x 40 hole pad boards which
fit my designs quite nicely at the right sort of size I&rsquo;m looking to construct
at. The connectors are right angled box headers and are simply soldered down
to the back of the boards whilst the LEDs run along the front. The LEDs
themselves are 3mm 12V types so that an additional resistor is not required
(which would make the &lsquo;crammed in&rsquo; Logic unit design even more tricky) and to
make construction a bit more manageable each LED sits in a right angled
holder.</p>
<p>Speaking of the LED holders, I was hoping to get hold of
the ones that can be joined together to keep everything nicely lined up but
was finding these tricky to get a supplier for so plumbed for the regular
&lsquo;free-standing&rsquo; ones in the end. I found, after much head scratching, that the
easiest way to get everything to line up was to place each holder with LEDs
fitted on to the board and then place packing between and behind each (braced
against a strip of non-soldered header pins) and then solder the whole lot in
one go.</p>
<p>I had a go at the simpler Arithmetic Card LEDs first and
here&rsquo;s the result (with design diagram for reference):</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>As you can see
it&rsquo;s not looking too bad and the LEDs are pretty well aligned. I&rsquo;ve also
soldered down the connectors but they&rsquo;re fairly straightforward to do so there
not much to say there. Moving on to the Control Card:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2013/2013-12-02-0002.png" alt="ALU Control Card LEDs">
<img src="/img/posts/2013/2013-12-02-0003.JPG" alt="ALU Control Card LEDs">
  
</figure>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t quite as
successful with these ones and you can see that post-soldering some of the
LEDs have taken on a bit of a slant to the left. It&rsquo;s not quite as noticeable
when you&rsquo;re not close up to them though so I&rsquo;m not too worried about trying to
correct them. Finally then, and after &lsquo;practicing&rsquo; on the other cards it&rsquo;s
time to attempt the LED fest of the Logic card. This time the holders are
bi-level so are a little more stable to work with but needs twice the amount
of soldering:</p>
<figure>

<img src="/img/posts/2013/2013-12-02-0005.JPG" alt="ALU Logic Card LEDs">
  
</figure>

<p>Again, not perfect
but good enough &hellip; it&rsquo;s a shame I couldn&rsquo;t get hold of the &lsquo;linkable&rsquo; holders
as it would have produced a really nice tidy result. One thing I have noticed
about the Logic card LEDs is that it&rsquo;s not easy to visually separate the five
sets of 8-bit results. I could do with adding a piece of differently coloured
plastic or something similar after every fourth LED to separate them a bit -
I&rsquo;ll add something later.</p>
<p>So, after all that soldering how many
LEDs survived? Well, all of them as luck would have it &hellip; appears my
soldering skills aren&rsquo;t as dodgy as I thought (or LEDs have become tougher
with advances in technology) &hellip; believe as you will ;) I&rsquo;ve taken a video of
the LEDs on the Logic card being tested &hellip; you&rsquo;ll just have to trust me that
the others work as it&rsquo;s not all that quick to take videos, run them through
iMovie and then upload them to YouTube:</p>

</figure>

<p>That&rsquo;s enough for this post &hellip; it always
surprises me how much solder I get though and this has been no exception so
far and there&rsquo;s much, much more soldering to go. Before I do add more to the
ALU cards though I&rsquo;m going to take a small break and put a bit of thought in
to how I&rsquo;m going to connect the cards together.</p>
