          <p>In this post I&rsquo;ll continue to try and explain away the various bits of the
architecture that will make up my relay computer project — this time it&rsquo;s the
Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). Here (yet again) is the architecture I&rsquo;ll be
building against (from the

<p>The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) sits at the
very heart of the computer and without it you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do much at
all &hellip; you could certainly move data back and forth between the memory and
registers but that&rsquo;d be about it. As you might have guessed from the name it
allows the computer to perform arithmetic and logic functions. Some ALUs have
a myriad of functionality available but this architecture takes a good balance
between simplicity and functionality — the idea being that you can perform
more complex functions by using a combination of simpler ones (subtraction can
be performed by negating a number then adding it and multiplication can be
performed by repeated adding). This does mean that the computer takes longer
to do some things, like subtraction and multiplication, but it&rsquo;s much simpler
to construct as a result.</p>
<p>The ALU takes its inputs from the B and C
registers (although for some operations C is ignored). The result the ALU
produces goes back on to data bus. In theory you could physically store the
result in any of the writable 8-bit registers (except B and C which are used
as inputs) however in practice the result would be placed in A or D.</p>
<p>For the arithmetic side of things the ALU can perform two operations: Add
and Increment. Add takes the values in B and C and produces the sum B + C.
Increment takes the value in B (ignoring C) and produces the sum B + 1. There
are five logic functions: AND (and), OR (inclusive or), XOR (exclusive or),
NOT (not) and SHL (shift left). AND, OR and XOR operate on B and C inputs as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>B    10101010
C    11001100
-------------
AND  10001000
OR   11101110
XOR  01100110
</code></pre>
<p>So AND for a given bit is 1 when both B and
C are 1. OR for a given bit is 1 when either B or C (or both) are 1. XOR for a
given bit is 1 when either B or C (but not both) are 1. When we use &lsquo;or&rsquo; in
everyday speech, of course, we are usually using the exclusive or (you can
have tea or coffee &hellip; not a steaming hybrid of teffee). The NOT function
works on the B input only and operates as follows:</p>
<pre><code>B    10101100
-------------
NOT  01010011
</code></pre>
<p>That is, NOT for a given bit is 1 when B is
0 and 0 when B is 1. Finally we have SHL (shift left) which operates on the B
input only as follows:</p>
<pre><code>B    10101100
-------------
SHL  01011001
</code></pre>
<p>This moves each bit in B one place to the
left with the left/highest bit rotated back to the right/lowest bit.</p>
<p>In order to be even more use to a programmer the ALU contains three special
1-bit &lsquo;condition registers&rsquo;. These are set following each ALU operation as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Z - Zero. Set when the ALU result is zero (all bits are 0).</li>
<li>Cy - Carry. Set when an ALU addition or increment resulted in a
bit being carried. An example of where this would be set is when adding 1 to
the number 255 (11111111) &hellip; the 1 would ripple through the result creating
00000000 with 1 carried. The carry condition shows in this case that we&rsquo;ve
added one more than we could hold in an 8-bit value (what&rsquo;s known as an
overflow). Actually, the ALU can use this flag to pull off 16-bit addition -
you would add the lower 8-bit numbers together then add the upper 8-bit
numbers along with an extra 1 if the carry condition was set on the first
addition (just as you would when doing long addition by hand with decimal
numbers).</li>
<li>S - Sign. Set when the ALU result has the left/highest bit
set. This would mean the value is negative when we&rsquo;re treating the results as
signed numbers. If we&rsquo;re treating the numbers as unsigned then this condition
has no meaning &hellip; effectively it will be set when the number is 128 or
more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually the condition registers are used to make
decisions/jumps in a program so for example if I wanted to check if two signed
numbers added together produce a negative result I would load one in to
register B and the other in register C then perform the add and check the sign
condition &hellip; if the sign condition is set then the result was negative and I
can jump to a different line in the program, if not I can carry on with the
next line as normal. This actually leads quite nicely on to my final
instalment on the architecture &hellip; how a program actually executes and
controls the computer.</p>
