          <p>In this post I&rsquo;ll wrap up this &lsquo;mini-series&rsquo; of trying to explain away the
various bits of the architecture that will make up my relay computer project —
finally now we come on to Programming and Control of the computer. Here again,
for the last time, is the architecture I&rsquo;ll be building against (from the

<p>With all the various parts of the
architecture I&rsquo;ve discussed so far — the busses, registers, memory and ALU —
we have a computer that could be manually operated, albeit laboriously, to
perform various tasks. Actually, in fact, this will be the first milestone in
the construction of my computer &hellip; that I can manually operate what I have
built so far just as the computer will itself when it is able to execute
programs. Just to give you a feel for exactly how labour intensive even a
simple task would be here are the manual steps to subtract 6 from 10:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enter the value 10 (in binary as 00001010) on to the data bus (there
will be physical toggle switches to allow the user to do this).</li>
<li>Turn the load switch on then back off again on the C register. This will store the
value 10 on this register.</li>
<li>Enter the value 6 (in binary as 00000110) on to the data bus.</li>
<li>Turn the load switch on then back off again on the
B register. This will store the value 6 on this register.</li>
<li>We are now
in our starting state for performing the subtraction. However, the ALU doesn&rsquo;t
have a subtract function so we&rsquo;re going to have to do a little more work
ourselves.</li>
<li>Set the ALU to the NOT function. Load register A (toggle
the load switch on then off). Turn off the ALU.</li>
<li>Select register A
(turn on the select switch so that its value is placed on the data bus) and
load register B then turn off the select switch on register A. The value NOT-6
is now copied in to register B (replacing the original 6 value).</li>
<li>Set
the ALU to the Increment function, load register A then turn off the ALU. We
now have the value (NOT-6)+1 &hellip; the <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_number_representations">two&rsquo;s complement</a>
of 6 which represents -6 in binary.</li>
<li>Again, select register A, load register B then unselect
register A. We now have -6 in register B and 10 still in register C. Finally
now we can add the numbers together.</li>
<li>Set the ALU to the Add function,
load register A then turn off the ALU. We now have the value 4 in register A
(-6 + 10) as expected.</li>
</ol>
<p>Phew, all that just to subtract two numbers
and we didn&rsquo;t even include taking the starting values from somewhere in memory
and then putting the result back in memory afterwards. Now of course, in a
modern computer the ALU will likely have a subtract function built in so the
above operation is much simpler (but at the expense of the ALU being more
complex) but even in a computer that does perform all the above operations all
of this happens in the blink of an eye. Well, that is, a blink of an eye for a
modern wholly electronic computer but what I&rsquo;m building here is a relay
computer which is electromechanical so it&rsquo;s not the fastest thing in the world
and so the above would take a fair bit of time to complete (depending
ultimately on how fast the relays can reliably switch before we get data
corruption creeping in).</p>
<p>You can probably see now that although
operating a computer manually to perform a task is certainly possible it&rsquo;s not
all that much fun (well, at least not after the first couple of times of doing
it). What&rsquo;s really needed is the ability to give the computer a set of
instructions/steps to follow that it can work through in its own time and then
get back to us when it&rsquo;s finished with the result. This is where the computer
program comes in &hellip; it&rsquo;s a set of sequential steps telling the computer what
action to perform. Sequential steps alone would be enough to perform our
subtraction routine above but where the real power comes is when the program
can take differing actions based on a result the computer is generating so for
example we could subtract the two numbers and then skip to a different part of
the program depending on whether the result was positive or negative (or zero,
or caused a carry — all driven by the ALU condition registers).</p>
<p>If
we look at the subtraction steps above we can break them down in to the
following operations (after placing the values 10 and 6 in the registers):</p>
<ol>
<li>ALU:NOT, Load A</li>
<li>Select A, Load B, Unselect A</li>
<li>ALU:Increment, Load A</li>
<li>Select A, Load B, Unselect A</li>
<li>ALU:Add, Load A</li>
</ol>
<p>If you imagine that each part of the
computer that can be manipulated has switches to control each operation (so
load/set registers, operate the ALU, load/store in memory, etc &hellip; basically a
big pile of switches). These steps are the switches that need to be toggled
for each step. You can maybe see a pattern developing here &hellip; some of the
steps are very similar. If we make things more concise again:</p>
<ol>
<li>ALU:NOT to A</li>
<li>Copy A to B</li>
<li>ALU:Increment to A</li>
<li>Copy A to B</li>
<li>ALU:Add to A</li>
</ol>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually two
classes of step here: one is to perform an ALU operation (placing the value in
A) and the other is to copy a value (from A to B). Equally we could perform
any of the ALU operations using the same &lsquo;class&rsquo; of step (and place the value
in a different register [but not B or C]) and we could move a value from any
register to any register. So, if we give the computer an instruction/step of a
certain &lsquo;class&rsquo; it will then know which switches to toggle and in which order
which means we can get on with the job of just telling it, at a higher level,
which steps to perform without worrying about what the computer will actually
have to do to complete that step. Equally, the computer can just concern
itself with performing the step exactly as requested without worrying about
the overall task. We now need somewhere to store the current step so that the
computer can work out which switches to throw and that&rsquo;s where the instruction
register comes in — we simply place an 8-bit value in here and that then tells
the computer what step to perform. Simply place?! Well, we need someway of
encoding all the possible task &lsquo;classes&rsquo; that the computer can perform along
with extra details (the copy command needs to know which register to copy from
and to for example) in to a single 8-bit value that the computer can then
decode. This encoded value is called an opcode (operation code) and the copy
instruction (or move as it&rsquo;s commonly known) and the ALU instruction work like
this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move/Copy (MOV) : 00sssddd
<ul>
<li>sss = source register (000:A, 001:B, 010:C, 011:D, 100:M1, 101:M2, 110:X, 111:Y)</li>
<li>ddd = destination register (000:A, 001:B, 010:C, 011:D, 100:M1, 101:M2, 110:X, 111:Y)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ALU (ALU) : 1000dfff
<ul>
<li>d = destination register (0:A, 1:D)</li>
<li>fff = function (000:not used, 001:ADD, 010:INC, 011:AND, 100:OR, 101:XOR, 110:NOT, 111:SHL)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, for
example: 00000001 is the opcode for MOV A to B; 10000110 is the opcode for ALU
NOT to A. You can see here now that although in theory you could store the ALU
result in any register other than B or C there&rsquo;s only room in the opcode for a
single bit &hellip; that&rsquo;s why we restrict ourselves to only allowing A or D as a
destination for ALU operations. There are several more opcode classes and I&rsquo;ll
put a post up a bit later which lists the full set. Hopefully now though you
can now see that by using the opcodes we can give the computer the following
instructions to perform the same subtraction program:</p>
<pre><code>10000110    (ALU:NOT to A)
00000001    (MOV A to B)
10000010    (ALU:INC to A)
00000001    (MOV A to B)
10000001    (ALU:Add to A)
</code></pre>
<p>As a quick aside
you can probably see that programming the computer is quite intense for the
person writing the program (the programer). To make things easier we can use
mnemonics to make the opcodes easier to remember and work with — one
particular set of these mnemonics is called assembly language and would look a
bit like the following:</p>
<pre><code>not a
mov b, a
inc a
mov b, a
add a
</code></pre>
<p>Much easier
to remember :) Note that each mnemonic has a matching opcode so effectively
before we can enter the program into the computer we need to convert the
mnemonics back into to opcodes. Incidentally, the sharp eyed out there might
have noticed that the move command is &lsquo;mov b, a&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;mov a, b&rsquo; as you
might otherwise expect &hellip; it does actually mean copy value a in to b but
convention dictates the move command has the destination followed by the
source in assembly language.</p>
<p>Wow, this post is getting quite big
and we&rsquo;re not quite there yet — we need to cover how we actually execute the
program now we&rsquo;ve created it. Let me give you, and I, a breather and I&rsquo;ll
continue in the next post.</p>
