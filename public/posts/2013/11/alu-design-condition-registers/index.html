          <p>This post covers the design of the ALU Condition Registers which along
with the 3-to-8 Function Decoder and Zero Detect circuit (both covered in my
previous posts) make up the ALU Control Card. There are three Condition
Registers in this computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carry: set when a bit is carried in
the Arithmetic Unit (which can also indicate arithmetic overflow depending on
the interpretation of the numbers being added).</li>
<li>Zero: set when the ALU
result is zero (all bits are off).</li>
<li>Sign: set when the most significant
bit is set (which would indicate a negative result for signed values). This
condition has no direct meaning for unsigned numbers (other than indicating
the number has a value of 128 or more).</li>
</ul>
<p>When the ALU performs an
operation the current values of these three conditions are stored in the
condition registers so that they can be referred to in other operations. An
example of this would be where given two numbers the first is negated and then
added to the second &hellip; if the two numbers are equal it will result in zero
and therefore the Zero condition will be set. Based on this condition register
being set you could then branch to a different location in the executing
program if desired. That is, for example, if number A and B are equal then go
to line C in the program. It&rsquo;s this &lsquo;branching&rsquo; functionality that elevates
the computer in terms of power and flexibility and the condition registers are
at the heart of this.</p>
<p>In the most basic terms we can store a single
bit in a relay as follows:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2013/2013-11-30-0000.png" alt="">
  
</figure>

<p>In its initial state the register is off and both the IN and HOLD
inputs are off. A value is applied to the IN output and then the HOLD input is
set on and the value at IN removed. If the value was set then the relay would
be activated allowing the HOLD input to keep the relay on. The relay will then
remain on until the HOLD input is set off. Separately to this power is
supplied directly to one of the other relay switches and provides an isolated
source of the value held in the relay.</p>
<p>This basic design does need
some &lsquo;support&rsquo; to gate the input to the relay to ensure that it is only fed to
the relay when needed and that the hold line is off when &rsquo;loading&rsquo; the relay
(this also ensures that the hold line can&rsquo;t back-feed the input line
accidentally). Adding these control and gating relays gives us the
following:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2013/2013-11-30-0001.png" alt="">
  
</figure>

<p>This may look a little over complicated at
first but is designed to avoid feedback and oscillation in the control lines
(where the relay would turn on and off rapidly turning it into a buzzer &hellip;
and eventually burning it out). The design for this register is, again, taken
from the <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/Relay/index.html">Harry Porter Relay Computer</a> (there&rsquo;s also a nice
explanation on the issue of feedback and oscillation here in the evolution of
this design). Using this base design I can now modify it to use my DPDT relays
and add the other two condition registers required:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2013/2013-11-30-0002.png" alt="">
  
</figure>

<p>It&rsquo;s quite a &lsquo;busy&rsquo; layout but breaking it down: the two relays at the
top right are the Load circuit supplying the input gate enable and register
hold lines; the two relays at the top left are the input gating circuit and
finally the bottom three relays are the registers themselves. The there inputs
are S, CY and Z &hellip; each has its respective condition register output CS, CCY
and CZ. There is also an additional CNZ which is Not-Zero (the inverse of
Zero) which is useful for simplifying the control circuitry that is driven by
these outputs. Likewise, if we needed, we could produce CNS and CNCY (not Sign
and not Carry) in a similar fashion. With the relays, inputs/outputs and wire
links hidden and partial ground rails added the design looks like this:</p>

<p>With the design for the Condition Registers now complete we have
everything needed to put the ALU Control Card together and that&rsquo;ll be covered
in the next post.</p>
