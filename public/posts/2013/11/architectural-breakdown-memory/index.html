<p>In my last post I wrote about the computer
registers, each of which can store a binary value — they&rsquo;re typically very
fast although there&rsquo;s a fixed number of them (in this computer there&rsquo;s eight
&lsquo;general registers&rsquo; A, B, C, D, M1, M2, X and Y). Needless to say we wouldn&rsquo;t
be able to do anything too exciting if we&rsquo;re limited to only 8 storage slots
and that&rsquo;s where the memory comes in — it&rsquo;s not as fast (relatively) as the
registers but it can hold many, many more values.</p>
<p>You can think of
memory as a set of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeon-hole_messagebox">pigeon holes</a>
with a finite number of slots/holes that can
each hold one value at a time. Each hole has a unique label on it so that we
can refer back to it and find a value we placed earlier. The memory in this
computer holds 8-bit values (also known as one byte &hellip; 1 byte = 8 bits) in
each slot and there are 32,768 slots in total. This memory would be described
as 32K because it can hold 32 kilobytes or 32 x 1024 bytes — note that there&rsquo;s
1024 bytes to a kilobyte rather than 1000 as you might expect because
everything is based on binary and the base-2 numbering system again. It&rsquo;s
worth noting that the values that are put in memory only stick around as long
as there&rsquo;s a power supply connected — as soon as the power is gone so are the
values. You may have heard of memory being described as RAM (Random Access
Memory) — this is so called because you can access the values in memory in a
random fashion, that is, in any order.</p>
<p>The memory takes an input
from the address bus and we provide the address of the location in memory we&rsquo;d
like to access here. Once we have an address we can then either set the value
in memory from the data bus or read the current value from memory on to the
data bus. So, if we set 0000000011001110 on the address bus then we&rsquo;d be
looking at the 206th slot in memory. As you can see dealing with addresses in
binary can be a bit of a mouthful so when programming the computer we tend to
use hexadecimal (base-16) notation which is more concise. For those not
familiar with hexadecimal (or hex for short) it uses the numbers 0-9 followed
by the letters a-f (so a=10 and f=15). This is quite handy because a single
hex digit covers all the values possible in a 4-bit binary value (so for
example, e in hex = 1110 in binary). Given this then we can describe the
16-bit address 0000000011001110 as 00CE (more commonly this would be written
as 0x00CE with the leading &lsquo;0x&rsquo; so it&rsquo;s clear it&rsquo;s a hexadecimal value).</p>
<p>You may have noticed, if you&rsquo;ve got a pretty sharp eye for these
things, that the address bus is 16-bit which means it can hold 2^16 = 65536
unique values (the maximum value being 65535 or 0xFFFF) however our memory is
32K meaning there are 32768 unique slots (the last slot being number 32767 or
0x7FFF or 0111111111111111 in binary). Why the mismatch? Well, we don&rsquo;t have
to assign all of the address values/spaces to the memory - we might want to
attach other devices to the computer later on which would sit on those other
addresses. A good example of this would be a monochrome monitor/screen. If you
think of the monitor being divided up into rows and columns of pixels then
each pixel would be either on or off (1 or 0). If you group up 8 pixels
together then that&rsquo;s one byte and each series of 8 pixels could be referred to
with a unique address. If the monitor started at address 0x8000 then setting
the value 10101010 at address 0x8002 would turn on a pattern of pixels
starting at the 16th pixel of the first row. From a construction point of view
dividing the address space into two halves makes things simpler for sending
the address to the right location &hellip; taking the highest bit of the address
then a zero means the address is destined for the memory whereas a one sends
it to whatever I end up deciding to attach to the computer.</p>
<p>One
thing very worthy of note for this computer is that it employs a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">Von Neumann architecture</a>.
In this type of architecture the
program the computer is running is stored in the memory along with the data
used by the actual program itself. This makes things simpler compared with a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_architecture">Harvard architecture</a>
where the data store is physically
separate from the program storage (although the Harvard architecture does have
other advantages such as you can read the next program instruction whilst
moving data around due to the dedicated buses — as always with these things
there&rsquo;s a trade off). An interesting side effect of storing the computer
program in the same memory as data is that the programmer can design a program
that modifies itself while it is running which can make the program either
very efficient or very hard to debug when things go wrong depending on your
viewpoint ;)</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s now just two parts of the architecture
left to discuss: the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and how a program actually
executes and controls the computer.</p>
