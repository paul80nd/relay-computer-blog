          <p>Quite a while ago I
<a href="/posts/2019/01/change-of-approach/">decided to give up on the tedious wire wrap technique</a>
for building my cards. Although it was certainly more authentic and in-keeping with my computer&rsquo;s theme it was
massively time consuming for me and was ultimately putting me off making progress on construction.</p>
<p>Another problem with my previous construction methods was creating monstrosities like this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2016/2016-04-11-0001.jpg" alt="W Backplane Rear View">
  
</figure>

<p>This is the &lsquo;W&rsquo; backplane connector which connects five of the &lsquo;W&rsquo; type cards together &hellip; and its as precarious as
it looks and over time I&rsquo;ve found the ribbon cable on the back of these backplanes are getting a bit temperamental.
If left well alone they&rsquo;re fine but any knocks or pokes and whole lines can become disconnected. To solve this I
<a href="/posts/2019/03/making-a-pcb/">made my own PCB</a> for the Y backplane removing the need for the ribbon cable:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2019/2019-01-14-0002.png" alt="Backplane Y PCB">
  
</figure>

<p>Unsurprisingly then I&rsquo;m fully intending to replace the remaining backplane cards utilising a similar approach. However,
I&rsquo;m not completely mad &hellip; I won&rsquo;t be making these PCBs by hand and will get a proper PCB company to manufacture these cards
instead. As such, I&rsquo;ve already got the design underway with bays W, Y and Z designed so far:</p>

  <figcaption markdown="span">Z Backplane</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>Now, this is a big step forward in reliability for the backplane cards but there still something I&rsquo;m not totally happy about:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2022/2022-11-05-0007.jpg" alt="Photo view (top)">
  
</figure>

<p>It&rsquo;s (what I can only describe as) a &rsquo;nest&rsquo; of ribbon cables. To be fair, this is a photo taken on one of the computer&rsquo;s
&rsquo;tidier&rsquo; days and more usually there&rsquo;s cables all over the place and everything is visually chaotic. This is something that&rsquo;s
always bothered me especially when I&rsquo;m tracking down a fault or need to work around the backplanes.</p>
<p>So, the thought process went like this &hellip; if I can replace ribbon cables on the backplane itself why can&rsquo;t I do something
similar for the ribbon cables running between the backplanes? &hellip; and then it hit me &hellip; why not just replace the ribbon cables
in that area with another PCB &hellip; a &lsquo;daughterboard&rsquo; that plugs into the back of each backplane.</p>
<p>Well, yup, there&rsquo;s designs for those too &hellip;</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2022/2022-11-05-0008.png" alt="Photo view (top)">
  
</figure>

<p>These daughterboards then connect to each other via a single ribbon cable and you can see where the backplane &lsquo;X&rsquo; daughter
board will go in this pattern at the top left.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really pleased with the aesthetics of these and, actually, I had the W backplane manufactured a while ago along with a
slightly earlier version of the W daughterboard design above. I didn&rsquo;t get around to blogging about it at the time (that&rsquo;s now
<em>this</em> post) but here&rsquo;s some pictures:</p>

</figure>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been keeping an eye out on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/paul80nd">YouTube channel</a> you&rsquo;ll know I&rsquo;m nearing
the completion of the design for the clock card. Well, as always, these videos are produced quite a bit ahead of the date
I publish them so actually I&rsquo;ve already received the manufactured clock PCB but also received the revised W backplane
daughterboard along with the Z and Y backplane/daughterboard pairs. I&rsquo;ll fit these to the computer in due course and
blog or video them if there&rsquo;s anything of particular note but failing that they&rsquo;ll just &lsquo;magically&rsquo; appear at some point.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to take a closer look at any of these you can find the full colour previews in PDF format as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/pdf/backplane-w-pcb.pdf">Backplane W</a> + <a href="/pdf/backplane-db-w-pcb.pdf">Daughterboard W</a></li>
<li><a href="/pdf/backplane-y-v2-pcb.pdf">Backplane Y</a> + <a href="/pdf/backplane-db-y-pcb.pdf">Daughterboard Y</a></li>
<li><a href="/pdf/backplane-z-v2-pcb.pdf">Backplane Z</a> + <a href="/pdf/backplane-db-z-pcb.pdf">Daughterboard Z</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also see the schematic for these cards (or even download the Gerber files and manufacture one of your own) at
the <a href="/pages/progress/">progress page</a> and <a href="/cards/backplane/">cards page</a>.</p>
