          <p>Those who have been
reading my posts and watching my videos (you have my sympathy) will know that
alongside constructing this computer I&rsquo;ve also been busy renovating a house I
bought almost a year ago. This is mostly why there&rsquo;s been a lot of theory and
design going on for the relay computer and not much construction &hellip; I haven&rsquo;t
actually had anywhere to do the construction &hellip; until now that is.</p>
<p>When I first viewed the house the upstairs back room was just screaming out
to be made in to a workshop for my electronics hobby &hellip; although in the end I
had to settle for workshop/guest room being as the house isn&rsquo;t solely mine.
Anyway, with that back room now fully decorated I was keen to get a workbench
of some kind in there. The space I had to work with was as follows:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-05-04-0000.jpg" alt="Back room space for workbench">
  
</figure>

<p>As you can see it&rsquo;s not the biggest space and to make things even
more complicated there&rsquo;s only slightly more than 30cm depth available on the
left (the door is just off picture to the left) and 50cm depth on the right
(where there&rsquo;s a window and a radiator). I&rsquo;d be happy with a bench that is
50cm deep but, of course, I can&rsquo;t have it overhanging in to the door way so
I&rsquo;d need a bench that starts at 50cm deep but goes back to 30cm at the left
hand side.</p>
<p>I spent quite a bit of time drawing up various designs
for a bench although all of them based around the concept of a work top that
sweeps from deep to, erm, not-deep. I wanted the bench top to be similar
height to a kitchen worktop, somewhere around 90cm high, so that I can either
stand or sit at the bench depending what I&rsquo;m doing. I also wanted plenty of
room for storage of boxes and the like. In the end I was veering towards a
design that would have a kitchen worktop fixed to the wall with supporting
legs along the front and then probably a couple of shelves mounted to the
wall. That said though I wasn&rsquo;t particularly keen to drill in to the freshly
plastered and painted walls I&rsquo;d had to shell out for a month beforehand.
Possibly some kind of free standing bench then?</p>
<p>As it happened I
had a moment of inspiration at IKEA (while shopping for some house tat). I was
wandering through the maze of furniture (the first bit in IKEA before the
restaurant and emporium of crockery) and happened upon the <a href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/categories/departments/living_room/11704/">IVAR</a> range
of shelving. It&rsquo;s a fairly plain and simple
pine shelving system &hellip; quite reasonably priced &hellip; but most importantly
comes in two depths &hellip; 30cm and 50cm. In the time it took me to negotiate my
way through the IKEA marketplace and in to the warehouse I had the finished
design in my head and picked up a trolly and went hunting in the isles for the
bits of IVAR that I needed.</p>
<p>The following day I put the IVAR
shelves up (as IKEA intended) to see if my design will still be plausible.
This is what it looked like:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-05-04-0001.jpg" alt="IKEA IVAR shelves">
  
</figure>

<p>Generally
the shelves look to fit in OK although I had miscalculated the position of the
radiator in my head so the right hand shelves rest against the radiator rather
than the wall as originally intended. It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that the shelves
as you see them here are incredibly unstable and that&rsquo;s because they need at
least three shelves in place to hold the sides steady and then following that
you add a cross brace to give it further stability.</p>
<p>With the basic
frame in place it was time to get hacking &hellip; and I can only apologise to
Ingvar Kamprad for what I did to his IVAR shelves &hellip;</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-05-04-0002.jpg" alt="IVAR shelves post-modification">
  
</figure>

<p>If you compare the two pictures before and after you can see that
I chopped down the side frames removing the front upper half and two cross
beams from each side. This gives me my rough bench design that I was after. To
give the whole thing better stability I added small metal corner brackets at
each point where the worktop meets a side post and the resulting structure is
pretty stable. I did all the modifications on a flat laminate floor downstairs
and with a spirit level I was able to ensure everything was straight and true
as possible. Finally I added some wooden brackets at the top of each post to
support a shelf &hellip; positioning it carefully so that when the shelf is in
place I won&rsquo;t be knocking my head on it all the time.</p>
<p>The final
task was then to add the shelf (which ties the two units together) and add a
&lsquo;bridging&rsquo; piece of shelf in the middle to create one long work top. This
bridging piece was just an IVAR shelf that I chopped down and sculpted a curve
in to. With that all done and with a few accessories thrown in the bench ends
up looking like this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-05-04-0003.jpg" alt="Completed workbench">
  
</figure>

<p>The
relay computer as it currently stands sits snuggly (by accident rather than by
design if I&rsquo;m honest) in the left hand unit and then on the right hand unit
I&rsquo;ve got two 4-way power outlets and a lamp. The only thing missing really was
a good surface to work on. I didn&rsquo;t want to leave it with bare wood as I&rsquo;d end
up burning it in no time when soldering or I&rsquo;d have trouble loosing fiddlier
components in the pattern of the wood. In the end I settled on a blue
anti-static mat which solved both issues.</p>
<p>So in the end I&rsquo;m quite
happy with the resulting workbench. It&rsquo;s fairly sturdy, I didn&rsquo;t have to trash
the walls to put it in and I&rsquo;ve got enough room to work and store things.
Here&rsquo;s a final picture of the workbench &lsquo;in use&rsquo;:</p>

</figure>

<p>&hellip; and
yes, finally, what you see here are the beginnings of the instruction register
which means construction is moving again and my next post will be about this
very card.</p>
