          <p>Over the last five posts I&rsquo;ve been building up the design of a set of cards so
that the computer will be able to understand and perform the MOV-8, ALU and
SETAB instructions. In this post I&rsquo;m putting together the final piece of the
jigsaw &hellip; the control card. This will take the instruction class from the
decoder (which derives its result from the instruction register) along with
the pulses generated by the sequencer to operate the various control lines of
the computer as required.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s quite a bit of ground to cover
here so I&rsquo;ll visit the design of each individual instruction first in this
post and then I can move on to bringing all the parts together on the new
control card in my next post.</p>
<h3 id="mov-8-8-bit-move">MOV-8: 8-bit Move</h3>
<p>This instruction
is the 8-bit move which selects the value in a given register on to the data
bus and then loads another register with that value. The instruction has the
code &lsquo;MOV-8&rsquo; but you&rsquo;ll often see the shorter &lsquo;MV8&rsquo; used in the control
design. The instruction takes the following form:</p>

<article class="box">
  <div class="content">
    <h4>8-Bit Move</h4>
    <div class="field is-grouped is-grouped-multiline is-family-monospace">
      <div class="control">

          <span class="tag is-primary">MOV8</span>
          <span class="tag is-success">8</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="control">
        <div class="tags has-addons are-medium" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <span class="tag is-link">0</span>
          <span class="tag is-link">0</span>
          <span class="tag is-info">d</span>
          <span class="tag is-info">d</span>
          <span class="tag is-info">d</span>
          <span class="tag is-info">s</span>
          <span class="tag is-info">s</span>
          <span class="tag is-info">s</span>
        </div>
        
      </div>
    </div>
    <pre class="is-size-7"><code>ddd = destination register (000-A, 001-B, 010-C, 011-D, 100-M1, 101-M2, 110-X, 111-Y)<br>sss = source register      (000-A, 001-B, 010-C, 011-D, 100-M1, 101-M2, 110-X, 111-Y)</code></pre>
  </div>
</article>


<p>So for<br>
example the instruction 00010011 would copy the value contained in the C
register to the D register. At the moment the M1, M2, X and Y registers aren&rsquo;t
designed or built yet (they&rsquo;ll be covered in a later post) so for now I&rsquo;ll
only be designing and implementing MOV-8 for registers A, B, C and D.</p>
<p>Mapping the instruction out as a diagram we get the following:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-03-31-0000.png" alt="MV8 Instruction Map">
  
</figure>

<p>The decoder handles
the first two bits of the instruction so it&rsquo;s just a case of hooking a
collection of relays together to handle the combinatorial logic of which
register to select from / write to. In terms of timing we need the
following:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-03-31-0001.png" alt="MV8 Timing">
<img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-03-31-0002.png" alt="MV8 Timing Pulses">
  
</figure>

<p>The first timing
diagram shows how the source register is selected on to the data bus at the
same time that the destination register is loaded but then the source register
is held on for longer to ensure that the value has loaded before it&rsquo;s taken
off the bus. In terms of pulses P-C and P-D provide everything needed for this
instruction.</p>
<p>Taking the above three diagrams together the relay
design is as follows:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-03-31-0003.png" alt="MV8 Relays">
  
  <figcaption markdown="span">MV8 Relays (<a href="/img/posts/2015/2015-03-31-1000.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>The relays are made up of
three distinct areas of functionality:</p>
<ol>
<li>FSM Abort: The top left relay sets the AT08 line which tells the sequencer that this is an 8-cycle
instruction (and so the FSM should reset at stage 8). This only happens when the instruction is the
expected MV8 and at the appropriate time (set by the CHAT signal which will be covered shortly).</li>
<li>Source Select: The right hand column of three plus the upper middle relay handle the register
selection. These simply decode bits 0, 1 and 2 of the instruction to select the appropriate register
as long as pulse C is active (and we&rsquo;re performing the MV8 instruction).</li>
<li>Destination Select: The middle column of three plus the middle left relay handle the register load.
Similarly these decode bits 3, 4 and 5 of the instruction to load the appropriate register as long as
pulse D is active (and we&rsquo;re performing the MV8 instruction).</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing to note on the relay diagram above is
the RLA and RSA lines (register select A and register select B respectively)
are marked with a star. These two lines will need a diode placed shortly after
the outputs as other parts of the control card will also produce this signal
and the diode will ensure one part doesn&rsquo;t back feed in to another. The other
lines either aren&rsquo;t used elsewhere on the control card or back feed wouldn&rsquo;t
cause any problems.</p>
<h3 id="alu-arithmeticlogic">ALU: Arithmetic/Logic</h3>
<p>This instruction
commands the ALU to perform a given operation on the value in register B (and
optionally register C for operations with two inputs) placing the result on
the data bus. The result is then placed in to either register A or D as
required. The instruction takes the following form:</p>

<article class="box">
  <div class="content">
    <h4>ALU Operation</h4>
    <div class="field is-grouped is-grouped-multiline is-family-monospace">
      <div class="control">
        <div class="tags has-addons are-medium">
          <span class="tag is-primary">ALU</span>
          <span class="tag is-success">8</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="control">
        <div class="tags has-addons are-medium" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <span class="tag is-link">1</span>
          <span class="tag is-link">0</span>
          <span class="tag is-link">0</span>
          <span class="tag is-link">0</span>
          <span class="tag is-info">r</span>
          <span class="tag is-info">f</span>
          <span class="tag is-info">f</span>
          <span class="tag is-info">f</span>
        </div>
        
      </div>
    </div>
    <pre class="is-size-7"><code>  r = destination register (0-A, 1-D)<br>fff = function code (000-NOP, 001-ADD, 010-INC, 011-AND, 100-OR, 101-XOR, 110-NOT, 111-SHL)</code></pre>
  </div>
</article>


<p>So for example the instruction 10001011 would
perform the logic AND of the values in register B and C and place the result
in register D; the instruction 10000011 would increment the value in register
B by 1 and place the result in register A.</p>
<p>Mapping the instruction
out as a diagram we get the following:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-03-31-0004.png" alt="ALU Instruction Map">
  
</figure>

<p>The decoder handles
the first four bits of the instruction and in this case the ALU itself does
most of the hard work (the last three bits are mapped directly to the ALU
function code) so the only combinatorial logic needed in the control relays is
which register to write to. In terms of timing we need the following:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-03-31-0005.png" alt="ALU Timing">
<img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-03-31-0006.png" alt="ALU Timing Pulses">
  
</figure>

<p>The first timing
diagram shows how the ALU is commanded which places the result on to the data
bus then whilst this value is present the destination register is loaded. At
the same time the condition register is also loaded. The ALU is brought on
early enough to let the value settle and long enough to ensure the registers
have picked the value up. In terms of pulses P-D and P-E provide everything
needed for this instruction.</p>
<p>Taking the above three diagrams
together the relay design is as follows:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-03-31-0007.png" alt="ALU Relays">
  
  <figcaption markdown="span">ALU Relays (<a href="/img/posts/2015/2015-03-31-1001.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>The relays are made up of
four distinct areas of functionality:</p>
<ol>
<li>FSM Abort: The second relay (in from the left) sets the AT08 line (just as the MOV-8 one does) telling the
sequencer that this is an 8-cycle instruction. This only happens when the instruction is the expected ALU and at
the appropriate time (set by the CHAT signal which will be covered shortly).</li>
<li>Condition Load: The first relay sets the condition load line when pulse D is active (and we&rsquo;re performing the
ALU instruction).</li>
<li>Destination Select: The middle relay loads either the A or D register according to bit 3 of the instruction
whilst pulse D is active (and we&rsquo;re performing the ALU instruction).</li>
<li>ALU Function: The last two relays gate bits 0, 1 and 2 of the instruction directly on to the ALU function code
lines whilst pulse E is active (and ALU instruction is active). This causes the ALU to gate its result on to the
data bus.</li>
</ol>
<p>As
mentioned earlier, the control design for the ALU instruction is relatively
straightforward as most of the hard work is done by the ALU card
itself.</p>
<h3 id="setab-load-immediate">SETAB: Load Immediate</h3>
<p>This instruction places a value
contained within the instruction itself directly in to either the A or B
register. The instruction has the code &lsquo;SETAB&rsquo; but you&rsquo;ll often see the
shorter &lsquo;SET&rsquo; used in the control design. The instruction takes the following
form:</p>

<article class="box">
  <div class="content">
    <h4>Load Immediate</h4>
    <div class="field is-grouped is-grouped-multiline is-family-monospace">
      <div class="control">
        <div class="tags has-addons are-medium">
          <span class="tag is-primary">SETAB</span>
          <span class="tag is-success">8</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="control">
        <div class="tags has-addons are-medium" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <span class="tag is-link">0</span>
          <span class="tag is-link">1</span>
          <span class="tag is-info">r</span>
          <span class="tag is-info">d</span>
          <span class="tag is-info">d</span>
          <span class="tag is-info">d</span>
          <span class="tag is-info">d</span>
          <span class="tag is-info">d</span>
        </div>
        
      </div>
    </div>
    <pre class="is-size-7"><code>    r = destination register (0-A, 1-B)<br>ddddd = value (-16..15)</code></pre>
  </div>
</article>


<p>So for example the instruction 01101101
would load register B with a value of 00001101 (13); the instruction 01011111
would load register A with a value of 11111111 (-1). Effectively bit 4 of the
instruction is repeated in bit 5, 6 and 7 of the register meaning that any
value between -16 and 15 can be loaded up directly from the instruction.</p>
<p>Mapping the instruction out as a diagram we get the following:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-03-31-0008.png" alt="SET Instruction Map">
  
</figure>

<p>The decoder handles
the first two bits of the instruction and with bits 0 through to 4 being gated
directly to the data bus there&rsquo;s only the combinatorial logic of which
register to write to left to do. In terms of timing we need the following:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-03-31-0009.png" alt="SET Timing">
<img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-03-31-0010.png" alt="SET Timing Pulses">
  
</figure>

<p>The first timing
diagram shows how the value encoded within the instruction register is
selected on to the data bus and then whilst that&rsquo;s present the destination
register is loaded. As before the incoming value is kept around long enough to
ensure the destination register has had time to pick up the value. In terms of
pulses P-D and P-E provide everything needed for this instruction.</p>
<p>Taking the above three diagrams together the relay design is as follows:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-03-31-0011.png" alt="SET Relays">
  
  <figcaption markdown="span">SET Relays (<a href="/img/posts/2015/2015-03-31-1002.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>The relays are made up of
three distinct areas of functionality:</p>
<ol>
<li>FSM Abort: As with the
MOV-8 and ALU instructions the middle relay sets the AT08 line to tell the
sequencer that this is an 8-cycle instruction. As before this only happens
when the instruction is the expected SET and at the appropriate time (set by
the CHAT signal which will be covered next).</li>
<li>Immediate Gating: The
left relay sets the I2B signal which will gate the value held in the lowest 5
bits of the instruction register on to the data bus. This happens whilst pulse
E is active and only when performing the SET instruction.</li>
<li>Destination
Select: The right relay handles the loading of either register A or B
depending on bit 5 of the instruction whilst pulse D is active (and we&rsquo;re
performing the ALU instruction).</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing to note is that the
I2B relays aren&rsquo;t shown here and that&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re not going on the
control card. This is because they&rsquo;ll need both the data and instruction buses
together which can only be found on type &lsquo;X&rsquo; cards. Fortunately there&rsquo;s plenty
of space free on the instruction register card (which is type &lsquo;X&rsquo; as desired).
The relays simply gate the values bit for bit but with bit 5 of the
instruction duplicated on to bits 6, 7 and 8 of the data bus as mentioned
earlier.</p>
<h3 id="chat-control-abort">CHAT: Control Abort</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned the CHAT signal
repeatedly which is used by the control relays for each of the MOV-8, ALU and
SETAB instructions. This tells the control relays when it&rsquo;s a good time to
announce the AT08 signal to the sequencer so it knows that it&rsquo;s an 8-cycle
instruction that&rsquo;s being performed and that it should reset after 8 steps. The
CHAT signal is raised on pulse D and then the resulting AT08 signal is latched
in place by the sequencer until it needs it.</p>
<p>The relay that
controls the CHAT signal is very simple:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-03-31-0012.png" alt="CHAT Relay">
  
</figure>

<p>&hellip; when pulse D is active
the power supply (V) is connected to the CHAT line.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about it
for this post. In my next post I&rsquo;ll complete the design for the control card
by placing the MOV-8, ALU, SETAB and CHAT relays and wire everything together.
I&rsquo;ll also cover the addition of the I2B relays on the existing instruction
register card design.</p>
