          <p>In part one of this two part post I introduced the design of the
control relays for each of the MOV-8, ALU and SETAB instructions. With these
in hand I can now move on to placing these on the control cards and wire
everything together. That&rsquo;s &lsquo;cards&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;card&rsquo; as the control relays
will be spread over two cards just like the sequencer relays are. This is
partly because there&rsquo;s more relays than would fit on a single card but mainly
because access to a wider range of busses is needed.</p>
<p>Getting stuck
in, here is all the relays laid out across the two new control cards:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-04-04-0000.png" alt="Control Relays">
  
  <figcaption markdown="span">Control Relays (<a href="/img/posts/2015/2015-04-04-1000.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>On the left hand card
there is the CHAT relay floating at the top right then down from there are the
three SETAB relays and below that the five ALU relays. On the right hand card
there is the eight MOV-8 relays. As with the sequencer card there will be more
relays added to these cards as further instructions are added.</p>
<p>Adding in the wiring posts, internal links and diodes gives the
following:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-04-04-0001.png" alt="Control Cards with added internal wiring">
  
  <figcaption markdown="span">Control Cards with added internal wiring (<a href="/img/posts/2015/2015-04-04-1001.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>The next job is to add the connectors so the relays can be wired
up to their inputs and outputs as required. As these cards are W1 and W2 types
they use the same connectors as the respective W1 and W2 cards of the
sequencer. These are the connectors we&rsquo;ll need, firstly for the &lsquo;W1&rsquo; card on
the left followed by the &lsquo;W2&rsquo; card on the right:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-04-04-0002.png" alt="Control W1 Connectors">
  
  <figcaption markdown="span">Control W1 Connectors (<a href="/img/posts/2015/2015-04-04-1002.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-04-04-0003.png" alt="Control W2 Connectors">
  
  <figcaption markdown="span">Control W2 Connectors (<a href="/img/posts/2015/2015-04-04-1003.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>These are the
usual right angle boxed headers used on previous cards and as before lines
marked &lsquo;***&rsquo; (or &lsquo;****&rsquo;) are reserved for future use with lines marked &lsquo;---&rsquo;
(or variants of) are unused.</p>
<p>The lines on the W1 connectors are as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>C/I-Bus (Control Bus + Instruction Bus)
<ul>
<li>I0-I7 &hellip; 8-bit Instruction Bus</li>
<li>F0-F2 &hellip; 3-bit ALU Function Code</li>
<li>CL &hellip; Condition Register Load</li>
<li>SN/CY/EZ/NZ &hellip; Condition Flags (Sign, Carry, Zero, Non-Zero)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OP-Bus (Operation Bus)
<ul>
<li>AT08 &hellip; Abort-8 Signal (Tells the FSM to reset at stage 8)</li>
<li>ISET/IMV8/IALU &hellip; Instruction Class (SETAB, MOV-8, ALU)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pulse Bus
<ul>
<li>P-C/P-D/P-E &hellip; Timing pulses C, D and E</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the W2 connectors the lines are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ctrl-X (Control Line Bus)
<ul>
<li>I2B &hellip; Immediate To Bus (Places the value encoded in a SETAB instruction on to the data bus)</li>
<li>LIN &hellip; Instruction Register Load</li>
<li>RES &hellip; Sequencer Reset</li>
<li>CLK &hellip; Clock Signal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ctrl-Y (Control Line Bus)</li>
<li>Ctrl-Z (Control Line Bus)
<ul>
<li>RLA/RLB/RLC/RLD &hellip; Register Load A, B, C, and D</li>
<li>RSA/RSB/RSC/RSD &hellip; Register Select A, B, C and D</li>
<li>ADD/INC/AND/ORR/XOR/NOT/SHL/ICY &hellip; Internal ALU control lines</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As with the sequencer cards the W2 card will need some
lines on the W1 connectors and vice-versa. The solution is the same where by
interconnections are made between the two cards so that they act as one larger
card. With the primary card connectors, internal interconnects and other
connector wiring added to the design we get the following:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-04-04-0004.png" alt="Control Cards with added connectors, interconnects and wiring">
  
  <figcaption markdown="span">Control Cards with added connectors, interconnects and wiring (<a href="/img/posts/2015/2015-04-04-1004.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of things that probably warrant
further explanation on the above diagram. Firstly you can see that some of the
lines going to and from the instruction relays don&rsquo;t run a direct route and
stop off at various points. This is where future instruction relays will be
placed and they&rsquo;ll also be interested in the same lines hence the diagram
above shows where the wires will actually go when the cards are constructed.
There&rsquo;s also an appearance of the additional diodes in the select register A
and load register A lines on the second card. These prevent feed back on these
lines as mentioned in my last post but the position of the diodes is again
placed to work around future relays.</p>
<p>As with other cards I&rsquo;ll want
a line of LEDs down the front of each card to display what&rsquo;s going on within.
Firstly for the W1 card on the left followed by the W2 card on the right we
have:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-04-04-0005.png" alt="Control W1 Card LEDs">
  
  <figcaption markdown="span">Control W1 Card LEDs (<a href="/img/posts/2015/2015-04-04-1005.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-04-04-0006.png" alt="Control W2 Card LEDs">
  
  <figcaption markdown="span">Control W2 Card LEDs (<a href="/img/posts/2015/2015-04-04-1006.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>The W1 card LEDs
show the ABT08 line status and that of the I2B line raised by the SETAB
instruction. This is then followed by the three bits of the ALU function code
raised by the ALU instruction. The W2 card LEDs show the load and select lines
of registers A through to D variously operated by all three instructions. This
is the followed by the condition register load line raised by the ALU
instruction.</p>
<p>Adding the indicators above to the cards along with
the power supply lines (which are soldered to the back of the card) we arrive
at the final design as follows:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-04-04-0007.png" alt="Final Control Cards Design">
  
  <figcaption markdown="span">Final Control Cards Design (<a href="/img/posts/2015/2015-04-04-1007.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>As always
should you wish to take a much closer look at this design you can find the
above <a href="/pdf/control-1.pdf">here in PDF format</a>.</p>
<p>Before I wrap up
this post there&rsquo;s one extra bit to sort out. The SETAB instruction needs a set
of relays to gate the lower bits of the instruction bus on to the data bus.
These relays can&rsquo;t be placed on the control cards as both the instruction and
data busses are required so instead they can live on the instruction register.
With these added I2B relays the instruction register design now looks like
this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-04-04-0008.png" alt="Update Instruction Register design including I2B relays">
  
  <figcaption markdown="span">Update Instruction Register design including I2B relays (<a href="/img/posts/2015/2015-04-04-1008.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>In the above diagram I&rsquo;ve faded out the existing
instruction register relays and wiring to highlight the new I2B relays added.
There&rsquo;s also the full version of the revised instruction register design
available as <a href="/pdf/register-in-2.pdf">here in PDF format</a>.</p>
<p>&hellip; and that&rsquo;s the
control card design complete for the MOV-8, ALU and SETAB instructions. This
now joins the designs for the instruction register, instruction decoder and
sequencer (including FSM and pulse distribution). The last job now is to add a
few more items to the front switch control card and the two display cards to
reflect the functionality I&rsquo;ve added in this batch of cards and then it&rsquo;ll be
on to construction.  Once I&rsquo;ve built all the cards above I&rsquo;ll be able to
manually load an instruction into the register and then watch it be executed
as I manually operate the clock line. The good news from there is that I only
need to add the clock card to get to the next level towards having a fully
working computer.</p>
