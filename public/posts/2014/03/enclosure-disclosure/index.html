          <p>Sorry, I
will try to rain in the terrible punning post titles.</p>
<p>This time I
wanted to share the thoughts and ideas I&rsquo;ve been having around building a case
to hold my computer when it&rsquo;s eventually complete. I wanted to use a material
that would be easy to handle and work with but also one that would produce a
nice looking result. I was initially drawn to using wood or possibly even
laser cut plywood but in the end I settled on aluminium profile as its sturdy,
easy to assemble and, I think, looks really great. In addition to this it&rsquo;s
available in a large variety of sizes, shapes and there&rsquo;s plenty of fixtures
and fittings available for it.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t come across it
before, aluminium profile is basically created by extruding aluminium through
a die to produce bars of varying lengths. The clever thing is that the dies
are shaped so that channels are produced that can fit bolts or screws to allow
profile to be joined together or for fittings to be attached. Also, the cross
section is designed to have maximum strength but minimal weight therefore a
given length of profile is very strong but very light. There&rsquo;s a quite a few
different manufacturers of profile, each with different cross section designs,
but I&rsquo;ve gone for the Bosch Rexforth range as I found they had the best
selection of connectors and fittings.</p>
<p>One of the key things with
aluminium profile is to choose a series (often determined by the width of the
profile cross section or sometimes by the slot size) and then stick to it.
This is because all the parts in a series are designed to work perfectly with
each other but not necessarily with parts from other series. As the total
weight of my computer won&rsquo;t be all that great I&rsquo;ve gone for the lightest
smallest series which is based on a cross section of 20x20mm with a 6mm slot.
A cross section of the 20 profile along with a 20R profile which has a rounded
edge looks like this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-03-01-0000.png" alt="20x20mm Aluminium Profile cross section">
<img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-03-01-0001.png" alt="20R Aluminium Profile cross section">
  
</figure>

<p>and when extruded to 100mm
looks like this (again, using the excellent SketchUp software):</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-03-01-0002.png" alt="20 and 20R aluminium profile at 100mm length">
<img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-03-01-0003.png" alt="20 and 20R aluminium profile at 100mm length (back view)">
  
</figure>

<p>There&rsquo;s many ways of joining profile together but by far
the simplest, and cheapest, is using a self tapping T25 core screw. This often
requires drilling a hole through the profile so that a torx screwdriver can be
inserted through the centre of the profile to tighten the screw but
fortunately aluminium is very easy to drill.</p>
<p>By the time the
computer is finished there&rsquo;ll be four backplane cards which can each carry up
to five cards. Based on this the basic frame of the enclosure looks like
this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-03-01-0004.png" alt="Enclosure basic frame">
  
</figure>

<p>Each quarter of
the frame then has a board on the floor and ceiling (probably made of Diabond
aluminium composite for strength and lightness) to which PCB guides are
attached. The backplane is then secured at the back of the frame and the cards
are slotted in from the front. This is what it would look like:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-03-01-0005.png" alt="Enclosure quarter with cards">
  
</figure>

<p>With all
four quarters fitted with floor, ceiling, backplane and cards it would look
like this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-03-01-0006.png" alt="Enclosure with all cards fitted">
  
</figure>

<p>To
finish the enclosure off the sides are fitted with smoked acrylic panel. This
sits in the recesses of the profile and is cushioned by a rubber strip. For
the front and back of the enclosure there is a smoked acrylic panel retained
by profile that will be secured by magnets slotted in the profile recesses
along the joining faces. This allows easy access to the cards when needed
whilst allowing the card LEDs to be visible when the panel is attached. Here
is a picture of that front panel detached:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-03-01-0007.png" alt="Enclosure with removable panel">
  
</figure>

<p>and
finally here is the complete enclosure with front and rear panels attached:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-03-01-0008.png" alt="Complete enclosure from front">
<img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-03-01-0009.png" alt="Complete enclosure from back">
  
</figure>

<p>The
enclosure above will actually form one of three units &hellip; this being the card
unit. Additionally there will be a switch unit which holds the main control
switches and then a display unit which will contain the control bus displays
and diagnostic switches along with the main data/address bus and status
displays. These additional units only exist in my head at the moment but I&rsquo;ll
start transferring them in to SketchUp and then share them in a future post.</p>
