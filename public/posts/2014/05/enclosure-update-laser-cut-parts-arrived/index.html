          <p>I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to this moment for nearly a month &hellip; the laser cut
parts I ordered to move my enclosure construction forward have finally
arrived.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-05-03-0000.jpg" alt="Laser cut parts in packaging">
<img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-05-03-0001.JPG" alt="Card bay floor/ceiling panel (top side)">
<img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-05-03-0002.JPG" alt="Card bay floor/ceiling panel (bottom side)">
  
</figure>

<p>The picture on the left is viewing the part from the top side and
the one on the right from the underside. The part was cut with the top side
facing up and so the bottom side has picked up plenty of burn marks which is
reasonably inevitable when cutting plywood with a laser. The odd hexagon
shaped burns on the underside come from, I think, the cutting bed which has a
lattice structure with this shape. All of these burn marks can be carefully
sanded away but I actually quite like them &hellip; a mark of its provenance if you
like.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s eight of the card bay floor/ceiling parts so stacked
in a pile and fanned out they look like this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-05-03-0003.JPG" alt="8 x Card bay floor/ceiling parts">
  
</figure>

<p>That&rsquo;s
it for the plywood parts &hellip; everything else is made of acrylic. First up on
the plastic parts are these:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-05-03-0004.JPG" alt="Lower enclosure side panels">
<img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-05-03-0005.jpg" alt="Upper enclosure side panels">
  
</figure>

<p>On the left
are the panels that fit in the sides of the lower enclosure and on the right
are their equivalents for what will become the upper enclosure. As mentioned
in my last &rsquo;enclosure post&rsquo; the upper enclosure isn&rsquo;t fully designed yet but I
had spare space on the laser cut files so it seemed reasonable to take a
chance that the design won&rsquo;t change in height at least. Both of these parts
are made of smoked acrylic so have a certain degree of transparency which
doesn&rsquo;t show up all that well on the photos above. These parts are both fairly
simple cuts although one thing that might not be immediately visible is that
each of the corners is ever so slightly rounded off (to a few mm) to avoid any
bumps or knocks starting a stress fracture (acrylic can hold high stresses
around cut lines especially on sharp turns).</p>
<p>In addition to the
side panels above there are two similar parts which fit the front and back
doors of the lower enclosure:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-05-03-0006.jpg" alt="Front/back door panels">
  
</figure>

<p>As you can no
doubt see in this photo all the acrylic parts are covered in a lot of dust
which has also come from the laser cutting process. One side of the acrylic
has a protective film but the other side doesn&rsquo;t so I have to be quite careful
when cleaning them as acrylic is quite susceptible to scratching (in addition
to sharing a certain fragility similar to glass). I&rsquo;ve ordered some special
acrylic cleaning fluid to help me buff out any hairline scratches as you
should never use normal cleaning products (and certainly not window cleaner
unless you want the whole panel to permanently fog up).</p>
<p>The door
panels have some special detailing on the corners that allow them to fit
around the brackets that hold the door together. Close up they look like
this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-05-03-0007.jpg" alt="Enclosure door panel (close up)">
  
</figure>

<p>Finally
I&rsquo;ve got my &lsquo;special&rsquo; panel which will be used on the upper enclosure to house
the main input switches:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-05-03-0008.JPG" alt="Switch Panel">
  
</figure>

<p>This is probably the most exciting part for me and it put a big
smile on my face as I saw it for the first time (even though it&rsquo;s from the
upper enclosure with its unfinished/unstable design so might end up getting
thrown away). I know it&rsquo;s probably not all that fashionable to be excited by
laser cut parts but there&rsquo;s a certain something about the finish and feel of
something that&rsquo;s been cut by a laser. That said, there is a slight problem &hellip;
in the same way the plywood parts pick up burn marks from the laser on their
underside the same is true for engraving on acrylic parts on the top side
(although they get more of a &lsquo;smudgy mark&rsquo;). Here&rsquo;s a close up of the switch
panel:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-05-03-0009.jpg" alt="Switch Panel (close up)">
  
</figure>

<p>You might have to click the picture above and take a look at the
larger version to see the smudge marks more clearly but it has the effect of
making the text a bit hazy. This should be no problem to clean up with careful
use of the acrylic cleaner I&rsquo;ve ordered &hellip; I may even chose to infill the
lettering if it still looks a bit rough afterwards. Fortunately I&rsquo;ve got some
acrylic I ordered quite a while back which was a test piece and features some
similar engraved lettering which means I can test any cleaning/infilling on a
throw away piece before doing it for real on the part above.</p>
<p>Right,
I&rsquo;m going to stop there for now. Believe it or not it actually take ages to
write these posts and get all the pictures together (well, it takes me ages at
least) and it&rsquo;s sunny outside (a relative treat in the UK) so I&rsquo;m going out to
enjoy it. I&rsquo;ve already fitted all the lower enclosure parts (in a fit of
excitement in a single evening) but I&rsquo;ll cover how that all went in my next
post.</p>
