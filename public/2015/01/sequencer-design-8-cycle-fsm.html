      <p>So far I’ve got the design complete for the instruction register along 
with the initial design for the decoder and so I’m well on the way to having 
the computer perform MOV-8, ALU and SETAB instructions. Later I’ll get on to 
the control card design where the computer will operate the control lines 
according to the 8-bit opcode stored in the instruction register. Before that 
though there’s the sequencer card which will generate the pulses that drive 
the control card.</p>

<p>There’s two halves to the sequencer card: the 
finite state machine (FSM) and the pulse distributor. I’ll cover pulse 
distribution in my next post as that is driven directly by the FSM. The FSM 
itself is driven by the clock signal which at the moment will be generated 
manually using the clock switch on the front of the computer but will 
eventually, of course, be generated automatically by the clock card.</p>

<p>The FSM moves from state to state on each clock transition, that is, when 
the clock line goes high-to-low or low-to-high. Because the sequencer operates 
on each clock transition the operating speed of the computer is twice that of 
the clock … so if the clock cycles 3 times a second (3Hz) then the computer 
can perform up to 6 operations per second (6Hz). Each state produces a pulse 
Sx’ that lasts one clock ‘tick’ and a pulse Sx that lasts two clock ‘ticks’ 
(one clock cycle). Diagram wise the pulses look like this:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2015/2015-01-26-0000.png" alt="Finite State Machine pulses" />
  
</figure>

<p>Eventually 
further states will be needed as more complex instruction classes are 
introduced but for now the MOV-8, ALU and SETAB instructions are all operable 
under an 8-cycle FSM.</p>

<p>The first step in designing the sequencer’s 
FSM is to extract the ‘ticks’ and ‘tocks’ (like the noise an old pendulum 
clock makes) from the clock signal so that we obtain one pulse train that 
matches the clock and one that is the inverse of the clock as follows:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2015/2015-01-26-0001.png" alt="Derived clock pulse trains" />
  
</figure>

<p>This is very 
straightforward with relays that contain SPDT switches as follows:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2015/2015-01-26-0002.gif" alt="Derived clock pulses circuit" />
  
</figure>

<p>At its 
heart the sequencer FSM consists of a ‘ring counter’ which will move through 
each state upon a clock transition and then resets following the final step. 
There’s quite a bit of wiring in a ring counter so I’ll start with a simpler 
example … here’s the counter design for four stages:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2015/2015-01-26-0003.png" alt="Four Stage Ring Counter / FSM" />
  
  <figcaption>Four Stage Ring Counter / FSM (<a href="/assets/img/posts/2015/2015-01-26-1000.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To get the 
four stage FSM above going the first stage relay at the bottom left needs 
activating … this can be done by temporarily activating the RESET line. Once 
the first relay is activated it is held on by the feed it receives from the 
third stage relay.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2015/2015-01-26-0004.gif" alt="4 Stage FSM: Starting State" />
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2015/2015-01-26-0005.gif" alt="4 Stage FSM: Reset/Ready State" />
  
</figure>

<p>With the 
first relay activated and the state machine ready to go the clock can be 
started which will then activate the second relay then the third and then the 
fourth. When the third relay is activated the first drops out and when the 
fourth relay is activated the second relay drops out and so on. This pattern 
of operation continues until the final relay is reached.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2015/2015-01-26-0006.gif" alt="4 Stage FSM: State 1" />
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2015/2015-01-26-0007.gif" alt="4 Stage FSM: State 2" />
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2015/2015-01-26-0008.gif" alt="4 Stage FSM: State 3" />
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2015/2015-01-26-0009.gif" alt="4 Stage FSM: State 4" />
  
</figure>

<p>When the final 
relay is reached the RESET line is activated starting the cycle again.</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2015/2015-01-26-0010.gif" alt="4 Stage FSM: Reset State" />
  
</figure>

<p>Note that when 
the FSM is resetting the fourth relay channels the active clock line to the 
RESET line which then activates the first relay which then in turn activates 
the second relay which cuts the hold line on the fourth relay turning it off. 
The diagram above shows the state the FSM ends in following all this 
happening.</p>

<p>To make a FSM with more stages the pattern of relays and 
wiring is carried on as far as needed. To make things a bit easier to see I’ve 
put together the diagrams above into an animated gif below showing the four 
stage FSM in operation:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2015/2015-01-26-0011.gif" alt="" />
  
</figure>

<p>As mentioned above the FSM on the sequencer card will eventually 
have many more states so for the 8-cycle instructions we need a way of 
reseting the FSM early and the abort relays will make this happen when set. 
This simply activates the RESET line earlier when needed.</p>

<p>Building 
on the simple 4 stage FSM here is an 8 stage version that can continue on to 
further stages with ABORT8 line to end at stage 8:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2015/2015-01-26-0012.png" alt="8-cycle finite state machine" />
  
  <figcaption>8-cycle finite state machine (<a href="/assets/img/posts/2015/2015-01-26-1001.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is the 8 stage FSM above 
that I’ll be transferring now to the sequencer card design. As with all the 
other cards I’m using relays that have two SPDT switches and building on the 
usual 55 x 40 hole pad board. Here are the relays and internal wiring for the 
8 stage FSM above:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2015/2015-01-26-0013.png" alt="Sequencer FSM Relays &amp; Internal Links" />
  
  <figcaption>Sequencer FSM Relays &amp; Internal Links (<a href="/assets/img/posts/2015/2015-01-26-1002.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As usual I’ll want the card to display the current state of the 
FSM so I can see what the card is up to. 8 red LEDs show states S1’ through to 
S8’ using the usual 12V LEDs with integral resistor. Note that only the Sx’ 
states are shown and not the longer Sx states effectively creating a single 
light that moves across the row of LEDs. Additionally there is a yellow LED 
above S8’ which shows when the ABORT8 signal is set thereby marking the point 
where the FSM will reset. Diagram wise it looks like this:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2015/2015-01-26-0014.png" alt="FSM LEDs" />
  
</figure>

<p>This pattern of LEDs will 
continue when extra stages are added to the FSM in future for the instructions 
that require longer cycles. Each block is made up of a bi-level LED holder 
with all the state LEDs on the bottom row and any abort LEDs on the top 
row.</p>

<p>Next up is the connections to other parts of the computer. In 
my last post for the decoder design I introduced the new W1 and W2 connection 
types. The sequencer will eventually be spread across two cards (one of each 
type) so that it has access to all the busses it needs and has enough room for 
all the relays that will eventually be required … I’ll cover this more in my 
next post when I add the pulse distribution to the sequencer. For now all that 
is needed is the clock signal and that comes in on the Ctrl-X bus via the W2 
connectors.</p>

<p>The ‘W2’ connections bring together the Ctrl-X, Ctrl-Y 
and Ctrl-Z busses that come in from the X, Y and Z type cards. The diagram of 
the connectors look like this:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2015/2015-01-26-0015.png" alt="Sequencer W2 Connectors" />
  
  <figcaption>Sequencer W2 Connectors (<a href="/assets/img/posts/2015/2015-01-26-1003.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This shows the 
three right angled boxed headers — from left to right these are: 10+10 Ctrl-X 
bus, 10+10 Ctrl-Y bus and 10+10 Ctrl-Z bus. Lines marked ‘***’ are lines that 
will be used by future ‘W2 type’ cards and the lines marked ‘—’ are 
unused/spare. Note that there’s no power connector on this board as that’ll be 
supplied by the W1 card which joins this card to make the full sequencer. The 
lines on each connector are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ctrl-X Bus (type X control bus)
    <ul>
      <li>LIN … Load Instruction Register</li>
      <li>RST … Clock Reset</li>
      <li>CLK … Clock Signal</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ctrl-Y Bus (type Y control bus)</li>
  <li>Ctrl-Z Bus (type Z control bus)
    <ul>
      <li>RLA/B/C/D … Register Load A/B/C/D</li>
      <li>RSA/B/C/D … Register Select A/B/C/D</li>
      <li>ADD/INC/AND/ORR/XOR/NOT/SHL … ALU Internal Function</li>
      <li>ICT … ALU Internal Carry</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>… and that’s about 
as far as I can go for now on the sequencer. My next post will cover the pulse 
distribution so that the outputs from the FSM are selected and combined to 
produce the timing pulses needed by the control card. To get this going I’ll 
have to design the second card (using the W1 connections) and cover how the 
two halves talk to each other. Once that’s done I’ll put up a PDF with the 
design of the two cards together.</p>
