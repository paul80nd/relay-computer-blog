          <p>I&rsquo;m just about at the half
way mark now for getting the computer to operate the MOV8, ALU and SETAB
instructions. The easier cards are out of the way now &hellip; time for the
slightly more complex ones. In this post it&rsquo;s the sequencer cards which will
deal with the &lsquo;when&rsquo; of instructions by sending out timing pulses which the
upcoming control cards will then use to operate the various control lines of
the computer at the right time.</p>
<p>Note there that I did say sequencer
&lsquo;cards&rsquo; and not &lsquo;card&rsquo; because there&rsquo;s two of them this time. This is the
first part of the computer that will be constructed across two cards stacked
together rather than all on a single card (the upcoming control unit will also
be spread across two cards). This is for two reasons: firstly the sequencer
needs access to more connections than a &lsquo;regular&rsquo; card but secondly there&rsquo;ll
be so much to fit in that it physically wouldn&rsquo;t fit on one card.</p>
<p>Working across two cards does present additional challenges in the
construction &hellip; mainly around how to get the required signals that are
private to the sequencer between the two cards. I considered many options but
in the end a system of stacking header pins seemed the best route forward. So,
to start construction I soldered down the ribbon cable connectors and board
interconnects &hellip; once done it looked like this:</p>
<figure>

<img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-07-08-0001.jpg" alt="Sequencer Cards: Connectors and Interconnects (rear view)">
<img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-07-08-0002.jpg" alt="Sequencer Cards: Connectors and Interconnects">
  
</figure>


<p>To keep the two cards stable I also added some PCB
stand-offs in the front corners. Thankfully the distance between cards in the
enclosure can be made up using standard stand-off lengths. I&rsquo;d like to say I
planned it that way but of course I didn&rsquo;t &hellip; it&rsquo;s just another one of those
happy coincidences which happens when everything is on a 0.1 inch grid.</p>
<p>To stack the cards the upper card header pins are aligned and inserted
into the respective sockets on the lower card producing a unit that looks like
this:</p>

<img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-07-08-0004.jpg" alt="Sequencer Cards: Cards stacked together (side view)">
  
</figure>


<p>With the basic connections in I moved on to soldering
in the wire wrapping posts for the interconnects and LEDs along with the LEDs
themselves.</p>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>One problem with the board interconnects on the upper card is that
it does make soldering a little fiddly as you have something protruding up
from the board getting in the way &hellip; plus that &lsquo;something&rsquo; will melt (or at
least the plastic parts of it will) if you apply a soldering iron to it.</p>
<p>For the LEDs I&rsquo;ve continued using the newer method of soldering the
LED cathodes together with bits of trimmed off diode/LED legs as it makes
soldering much easier. This is the first time, however, that I&rsquo;ve tried this
technique on double height LED holders. Generally the concept stays the same
&hellip; join all the cathodes together &hellip; but for the holders that have LEDs in
their upper slot I need to add a small Kynar wire link to get that LEDs anode
to the wire wrap post. It&rsquo;s all a bit fiddly but as long as you have patience
and a steady hand it usually comes off OK.</p>
<p>Next up were the relay
sockets and associated wire wrap posts:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-07-08-0009.jpg" alt="Sequencer relay sockets and wire wrap pins (top view)">
<img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-07-08-0010.jpg" alt="Sequencer relay sockets and wire wrap pins (rear view)">
  
</figure>


<p>I&rsquo;ve actually soldered down the relay sockets
for the upcoming 10 and 12-cycle relays on the lower card in addition to the
required 8-cycle relay sockets. This is because soldering these sockets down
is a really fiddly job and I know that when I come back to this card to add
functionality later it&rsquo;ll be a real pain when there&rsquo;s relays and all the
wiring getting in the way. I&rsquo;ll not bother soldering the underside of these
sockets much further but at least the fiddly upper side is done. I&rsquo;ve not done
anything on the upper card although eventually this will hold further cycle
relays all the way up to the full 24-cycle sequencer.</p>
<p>Next job was
to solder in the flyback and feedback diodes (which ensure produced outputs
don&rsquo;t feed back into parts of the sequencer&rsquo;s finite state machine):</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-07-08-0011.jpg" alt="Sequencer with added flyback/feedback diodes (top view)">
<img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-07-08-0012.jpg" alt="Sequencer with added flyback/feedback diodes (rear view)">
  
</figure>


<p>The final soldering job was to put in the
power and ground lines:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-07-08-0013.jpg" alt="Sequencer with added power and ground lines (rear view)">
<img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-07-08-0014.jpg" alt="Sequencer with added power and ground lines (rear close up)">
  
</figure>


<p>This time around I finally got bored of
cutting and stripping all those short bits of coated wire for the ground lines
and decided to give the same technique I use for grounding the LEDs a try for
the relays. This does mean that all the grounds are exposed for their full
lengths but on the plus side it was much quicker and easier to put everything
together. I&rsquo;ll see how I feel about it but I&rsquo;ll more than likely do the same
on the next card.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some temporary Kynar wires in the power
and ground lines and these are just to &lsquo;hop&rsquo; over future parts of the card
where the lines will eventually go through. The Kynar wire, of course, can&rsquo;t
handle all that much current but it should be fine for now.</p>
<p>With
the soldering done it&rsquo;s on with the wire wrapping. The sequencer probably has
the most complicated wiring yet (second only, maybe, to the ALU arithmetic
unit).</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-07-08-0015.jpg" alt="Sequencer with added internal connection wire wraps">
<img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-07-08-0016.jpg" alt="Sequencer with added power wire wraps">
<img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-07-08-0017.jpg" alt="Sequencer with added result wire wraps">
<img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-07-08-0018.jpg" alt="Sequencer with added control wire wraps">
  
</figure>


<p>With the wire wrap done the relays can then be placed in their
sockets:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-07-08-0019.jpg" alt="Sequencer with relays inserted">
  
</figure>


<p>This is almost the last step however to make the sequencer useable
up to the 8th cycle I need to add a couple of extra temporary Kynar links that
will connect stages 7 and 8 back to stage 1 and 0. Later on when longer cycles
are implemented stage 9 and 10 will provide the required lines to keep stages
7 and 8 alive &hellip; for now, in their absence, the first stages will do the same
job. With the temporary links in place the lower card looks like this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-07-08-0020.jpg" alt="Sequencer with added temporary wire links">
  
</figure>


<p>So, finally, that&rsquo;s the sequencer complete for 8-cycle
instructions. The card will be extended over time as longer cycle instructions
are introduced but for now the sequencer as a whole looks like this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-07-08-0021.jpg" alt="Completed 8-Cycle Sequencer (front view)">
<img src="/img/posts/2015/2015-07-08-0022.jpg" alt="Completed 8-Cycle Sequencer (rear view)">
  
</figure>


<p>As usual I&rsquo;ve put a video together that demonstrates the sequencer
in operation. In this video I give a quick overview of the cards and then
demonstrate running through the 8 stages of the finite state machine and
producing the three derived pulses C, D and E.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P2G8LHeWb80" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for the sequencer &hellip; at least for
now. It produces all the pulses that will be needed for the computer to
perform copying values between registers, loading values from the opcode and
performing ALU operations. The final step in making these operations a reality
is to construct the control unit &hellip; again though, just enough to operate
these three 8-cycle instructions. The control unit is similar to the sequencer
in that it will also be spread over two cards although fortunately it&rsquo;s wiring
will be quite a lot simpler as most of it is just combinatorial logic.</p>
