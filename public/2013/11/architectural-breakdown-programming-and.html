      <p>In this post I’ll wrap up this ‘mini-series’ of trying to explain away the 
various bits of the architecture that will make up my relay computer project — 
finally now we come on to Programming and Control of the computer. Here again, 
for the last time, is the architecture I’ll be building against (from the 
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/Relay/index.html">Harry Porter Relay Computer</a>)</p>

  <figcaption>System Architecture for a Relay Computer<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With all the various parts of the 
architecture I’ve discussed so far — the busses, registers, memory and ALU — 
we have a computer that could be manually operated, albeit laboriously, to 
perform various tasks. Actually, in fact, this will be the first milestone in 
the construction of my computer … that I can manually operate what I have 
built so far just as the computer will itself when it is able to execute 
programs. Just to give you a feel for exactly how labour intensive even a 
simple task would be here are the manual steps to subtract 6 from 10:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Enter the value 10 (in binary as 00001010) on to the data bus (there 
will be physical toggle switches to allow the user to do this).</li>
  <li>Turn the load switch on then back off again on the C register. This will store the 
value 10 on this register.</li>
  <li>Enter the value 6 (in binary as 00000110) on to the data bus.</li>
  <li>Turn the load switch on then back off again on the 
B register. This will store the value 6 on this register.</li>
  <li>We are now 
in our starting state for performing the subtraction. However, the ALU doesn’t 
have a subtract function so we’re going to have to do a little more work 
ourselves.</li>
  <li>Set the ALU to the NOT function. Load register A (toggle 
the load switch on then off). Turn off the ALU.</li>
  <li>Select register A 
(turn on the select switch so that its value is placed on the data bus) and 
load register B then turn off the select switch on register A. The value NOT-6 
is now copied in to register B (replacing the original 6 value).</li>
  <li>Set 
the ALU to the Increment function, load register A then turn off the ALU. We 
now have the value (NOT-6)+1 … the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_number_representations">two’s complement</a> 
of 6 which represents -6 in binary.</li>
  <li>Again, select register A, load register B then unselect 
register A. We now have -6 in register B and 10 still in register C. Finally 
now we can add the numbers together.</li>
  <li>Set the ALU to the Add function, 
load register A then turn off the ALU. We now have the value 4 in register A 
(-6 + 10) as expected.</li>
</ol>

<p>Phew, all that just to subtract two numbers 
and we didn’t even include taking the starting values from somewhere in memory 
and then putting the result back in memory afterwards. Now of course, in a 
modern computer the ALU will likely have a subtract function built in so the 
above operation is much simpler (but at the expense of the ALU being more 
complex) but even in a computer that does perform all the above operations all 
of this happens in the blink of an eye. Well, that is, a blink of an eye for a 
modern wholly electronic computer but what I’m building here is a relay 
computer which is electromechanical so it’s not the fastest thing in the world 
and so the above would take a fair bit of time to complete (depending 
ultimately on how fast the relays can reliably switch before we get data 
corruption creeping in).</p>

<p>You can probably see now that although 
operating a computer manually to perform a task is certainly possible it’s not 
all that much fun (well, at least not after the first couple of times of doing 
it). What’s really needed is the ability to give the computer a set of 
instructions/steps to follow that it can work through in its own time and then 
get back to us when it’s finished with the result. This is where the computer 
program comes in … it’s a set of sequential steps telling the computer what 
action to perform. Sequential steps alone would be enough to perform our 
subtraction routine above but where the real power comes is when the program 
can take differing actions based on a result the computer is generating so for 
example we could subtract the two numbers and then skip to a different part of 
the program depending on whether the result was positive or negative (or zero, 
or caused a carry — all driven by the ALU condition registers).</p>

<p>If 
we look at the subtraction steps above we can break them down in to the 
following operations (after placing the values 10 and 6 in the registers):</p>

<ol>
  <li>ALU:NOT, Load A</li>
  <li>Select A, Load B, Unselect A</li>
  <li>ALU:Increment, Load A</li>
  <li>Select A, Load B, Unselect A</li>
  <li>ALU:Add, Load A</li>
</ol>

<p>If you imagine that each part of the 
computer that can be manipulated has switches to control each operation (so 
load/set registers, operate the ALU, load/store in memory, etc … basically a 
big pile of switches). These steps are the switches that need to be toggled 
for each step. You can maybe see a pattern developing here … some of the 
steps are very similar. If we make things more concise again:</p>

<ol>
  <li>ALU:NOT to A</li>
  <li>Copy A to B</li>
  <li>ALU:Increment to A</li>
  <li>Copy A to B</li>
  <li>ALU:Add to A</li>
</ol>

<p>There’s actually two 
classes of step here: one is to perform an ALU operation (placing the value in 
A) and the other is to copy a value (from A to B). Equally we could perform 
any of the ALU operations using the same ‘class’ of step (and place the value 
in a different register [but not B or C]) and we could move a value from any 
register to any register. So, if we give the computer an instruction/step of a 
certain ‘class’ it will then know which switches to toggle and in which order 
which means we can get on with the job of just telling it, at a higher level, 
which steps to perform without worrying about what the computer will actually 
have to do to complete that step. Equally, the computer can just concern 
itself with performing the step exactly as requested without worrying about 
the overall task. We now need somewhere to store the current step so that the 
computer can work out which switches to throw and that’s where the instruction 
register comes in — we simply place an 8-bit value in here and that then tells 
the computer what step to perform. Simply place?! Well, we need someway of 
encoding all the possible task ‘classes’ that the computer can perform along 
with extra details (the copy command needs to know which register to copy from 
and to for example) in to a single 8-bit value that the computer can then 
decode. This encoded value is called an opcode (operation code) and the copy 
instruction (or move as it’s commonly known) and the ALU instruction work like 
this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move/Copy (MOV) : 00sssddd
    <ul>
      <li>sss = source register (000:A, 001:B, 010:C, 011:D, 100:M1, 101:M2, 110:X, 111:Y)</li>
      <li>ddd = destination register (000:A, 001:B, 010:C, 011:D, 100:M1, 101:M2, 110:X, 111:Y)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ALU (ALU) : 1000dfff
    <ul>
      <li>d = destination register (0:A, 1:D)</li>
      <li>fff = function (000:not used, 001:ADD, 010:INC, 011:AND, 100:OR, 101:XOR, 110:NOT, 111:SHL)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, for 
example: 00000001 is the opcode for MOV A to B; 10000110 is the opcode for ALU 
NOT to A. You can see here now that although in theory you could store the ALU 
result in any register other than B or C there’s only room in the opcode for a 
single bit … that’s why we restrict ourselves to only allowing A or D as a 
destination for ALU operations. There are several more opcode classes and I’ll 
put a post up a bit later which lists the full set. Hopefully now though you 
can now see that by using the opcodes we can give the computer the following 
instructions to perform the same subtraction program:</p>

<pre><code>10000110    (ALU:NOT to A)
00000001    (MOV A to B)
10000010    (ALU:INC to A)
00000001    (MOV A to B)
10000001    (ALU:Add to A)
</code></pre>

<p>As a quick aside 
you can probably see that programming the computer is quite intense for the 
person writing the program (the programer). To make things easier we can use 
mnemonics to make the opcodes easier to remember and work with — one 
particular set of these mnemonics is called assembly language and would look a 
bit like the following:</p>

<pre><code>not a
mov b, a
inc a
mov b, a
add a
</code></pre>

<p>Much easier 
to remember :) Note that each mnemonic has a matching opcode so effectively 
before we can enter the program into the computer we need to convert the 
mnemonics back into to opcodes. Incidentally, the sharp eyed out there might 
have noticed that the move command is ‘mov b, a’ rather than ‘mov a, b’ as you 
might otherwise expect … it does actually mean copy value a in to b but 
convention dictates the move command has the destination followed by the 
source in assembly language.</p>

<p>Wow, this post is getting quite big 
and we’re not quite there yet — we need to cover how we actually execute the 
program now we’ve created it. Let me give you, and I, a breather and I’ll 
continue in the next post.</p>
