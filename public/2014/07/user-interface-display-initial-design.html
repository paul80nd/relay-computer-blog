      <p>Following on from working on the main data switches in my last post 
this time I’ve taken the first steps in designing and constructing the first 
of two display cards which will sit in the upper enclosure. The first card 
(display A) has a dual purpose … it provides a display to show which control 
signals are in operation between the various parts of the computer but also 
allows the operator to manually control those signals when the computer is set 
to a special ‘diagnostic’ mode.</p>

<p>As with the data switches I knew 
all along what type/style of components I wanted to use to act as a display 
and switch over a single control line … in this case I’ve specifically gone 
for the NKK JB series which are illuminated tactile switches. These are 
momentary switches and available in either red, green or yellow (I’ll use all 
three colours in the final display). The switches are X/Y stackable so it’s 
quite easy to make keypad type layouts with them. Internally the switches are 
laid out like this:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-07-12-0000.png" alt="JB Series Switch (internal layout)" />
  
</figure>

<p>For 
each switch I’ll need to apply a label of some kind to indicate its function 
and this is where I can draw on some prior experience. My first job after 
leaving school at 16 was at a screen printing company in the reprographics 
department. This was around the point where computers were only just starting 
to be used in this industry and so I still did a lot of work by hand with 
pens, rulers and … more relevantly to this post … letraset (which is a 
sheet of transferrable lettering). This is perfect for my needs and 
fortunately (and quite surprisingly) it’s still available albeit in a limit 
range of fonts, sizes and colours (back at my first job there were huge 
catalogues of available styles). With the letraset applied to one of the JB 
key caps it looks like this:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-07-12-0001.jpg" alt="JB Key Cap with lettering applied" />
  
</figure>

<p>I’m 
quite pleased with how these look even though the lettering is a bit wonky 
(all part of the charm I guess). However, I’ve had to cheat a bit … the key 
cap as it appears above is made of two parts: the outer clear lens and an 
inner white body … apparently the two can be separated but I’m damned if I 
can do it without chewing up the plastic so I’ve applied the lettering 
directly to the lens and then covered it with sellotape (neatly folded around 
the corners) to protect it. If I ever do work out how to remove the caps I can 
always do it properly later on … and I know the tape and lettering comes off 
cleanly as I had to redo a couple of caps where I’d forgotten they only fit on 
to the switch base in one direction (so the lettering ended up rotated 90 
degrees from where it should have been).</p>

<p>With the switches selected 
and a method of labelling them tried and tested it was time to design the 
display board itself. As with the switch control board shown in the last post 
this board has gaps in it where more functionality will be added later on. 
This is the design so far with key caps on:</p>
<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-07-12-0002.png" alt="Display A schematic" />
  
  <figcaption>Display A schematic (<a href="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-07-12-1000.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The upper left set 
of eight switches control and display the A, B, C and D register load and 
select lines. The lower right set of seven switches control and display the 
ALU operations. Finally the two switches above those control and display the 
gating of the data switches on to the data and address busses respectively. 
The same diagram with switches removed looks like this:</p>
<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-07-12-0003.png" alt="Display A schematic (key caps removed)" />
  
  <figcaption>Display A schematic (key caps removed) (<a href="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-07-12-1001.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The control signals come in (and go out on) the three sets of 
header pins to the left of each switch group. These header pins will protrude 
from the back of the card so that a ribbon cable can be attached that heads 
off to another card where it’ll be wired out to the various busses of the 
computer. The top middle and bottom middle pins of each switch carries the 
illumination LED (anode at the top) and so from the bottom middle pin a 
connection to ground is made via a 560 ohm resistor (which is packaged in an 
eight resistor array). These means if a signal is coming in on a control line 
it will light the LED regardless of switch position. When the switch is 
pressed however it will link the power supply (which is only active when the 
computer is in the diagnostic mode) with the control line and the LED.</p>

<p>As always these schematics are available in PDF format <a href="/assets/pdf/display-a-1.pdf">here for the schematic with switches</a> and <a href="/assets/pdf/display-a-1a.pdf">here without the switches</a>.</p>

<p>So, with the design 
ready to go I could get out the soldering iron and get stuck in. The only real 
change from previous cards is that all the wiring is done on the back side of 
the card this time with soldered Kynar wire. Other than that there’s nothing 
too surprising or unusual in the construction so I’ll get straight on with the 
pictures. Here is the card as it currently stands viewed from the front:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-07-12-0004.jpg" alt="Display A (front)" />
  
</figure>

<p>… and from the back 
…</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-07-12-0005.jpg" alt="Display A (back)" />
  
</figure>

<p>… and finally here’s 
a couple of close up pictures focussing on the upper right and then lower of 
the back of the card …</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-07-12-0006.JPG" alt="Display A (back - upper right close up)" />
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-07-12-0007.JPG" alt="Display A (back - bottom left close up)" />
  
</figure>

<p>… and that’s it for now on this card. I’ve tested everything 
lights up properly and I’ll put a video together showing everything working 
after I’ve constructed the first parts of the second display card and wired 
everything in to the main computer cards.</p>
