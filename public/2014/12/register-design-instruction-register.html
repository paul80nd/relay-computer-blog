      <p>Well, it’s fair to say that I rather underestimated just how much time 
decorating the new house would take up … and that’s mainly because 
‘decorating’ included re-wiring, re-plumbing, re-plastering, re-carpeting … 
all before I got anywhere near choosing a tasteful shade of emulsion for the 
walls. Needless to say then that spending time on my relay computer has 
suffered quite a bit. However, things are starting to calm down (now that 
there’s two rooms in the house that are semi-habitable) so I can get back to 
designing the next bits for the computer.</p>

<p>The next card up for 
design is the (mercifully straightforward) 8-bit instruction register. I say 
straightforward as this card shares much of its design with the B/C register 
card already constructed. The instruction register is permanently connected to 
the instruction bus just as the B/C registers are permanently connected to the 
ALU. However where the B/C registers are general purpose, and so can be set 
from and selected to the data bus, the instruction register can only be read 
from the data bus.</p>

<p>So, as I’ve done in previous design posts, I’ll 
start with a card schematic of what the main bit relays look like for the 
8-bit instruction register when placed on the usual 55 x 40 hole pad board 
(excluding wire links):</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-12-01-0000.png" alt="8 bit register relays" />
  
  <figcaption>8 bit register relays (<a href="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-12-01-1000.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Each of the 
relays above stores a single 1-bit value so there’s 8-bits worth in total. 
Each of the bit relays need gating from the data bus so the register can be 
loaded when required. With these additional control and gating relays added we 
get the following (this time including internal wire links in the 1-bit 
register relays and result links between the 1-bit register relays and the 
gating relays):</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-12-01-0001.png" alt="8-bit register relays + gating relays" />
  
  <figcaption>8-bit register relays + gating relays (<a href="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-12-01-1001.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Additionally on the schematic above you can see there’s an extra 
diode per register bit relay — this is where the register bit permanently 
feeds the instruction bus and the diode ensures that the bus can’t 
accidentally back-feed into a bit relay. Actually, in this case, if the diodes 
weren’t there and back-feed did occur then the only effect would be a garbled 
LED display due to display of the real register value combined with the 
back-fed value. As things currently stand the instruction bus is only driven 
by this register and would never be in a position to back-feed anyway but the 
diode ensures this register card protects itself from any outside influences. 
There is, of course, a voltage drop across the diode to keep an eye on when I 
get to the design of the control card which will use further diodes to make up 
some of the combinatorial logic … the risk being that if the voltage drops 
too low any target relays may fail to switch properly. The relays I’m using 
(TE Connectivity <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/418/NG_SS_108-98002_W_P2-196265.pdf">V23079A2003B301</a>) are 12V but the coil can operate as low 
as 9V so given the 1V drop of the 1N4148 diodes I’m using I should be able to 
safely get 2 diodes in line before things get dicey. If I do get in trouble 
later I can either pop in a ‘relay’ relay downstream to pass the signal on and 
get the voltage back up to 12V or I can wire link over the diodes on this card 
and accept the risk of back-feed.</p>

<p>Relay wise that’s it for this 
card. As with all the register cards designed so far I’d like to display the 
current value being stored in the register (even though the same value is 
always present on the instruction bus). This allows me to confirm correct 
operation and test/debug the card independently. For this 9 LEDs are needed 
… 8 for the bit register values and 1 to show when the register is being 
loaded from the data bus. The LEDs are the same 12V ones used in all the 
previous cards (with an integral resister). Colour wise I’m continuing with 
the theme of red for a bit value and yellow for control signals. Diagram wise 
it looks like this:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-12-01-0002.png" alt="Register LEDs" />
  
  <figcaption>Register LEDs (<a href="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-12-01-1002.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Each block in the diagram 
represents a single 3mm LED in a plastic holder with each LED pushed into the 
holder from the front and the pair of LED legs then bent at 90 degrees.</p>

<p>Next up is the connections to other parts of the computer and there’s 
something new this time. All the cards designed so far have been marked ‘type 
Z’ and they share a common set of connectors on the back of the card such that 
Z cards can talk to each other directly as needed. There are five Z cards 
which fit in to the corresponding Z backplane that sits in the lower left bay 
of the enclosure. The instruction register card requires slightly different 
connections (like the instruction bus) and doesn’t need some of the Z 
connections (like the B/C bus) so this card will be a new ‘type X’ card. As 
you might expect X cards can talk directly to other X cards via a new X 
backplane and the X and Z backplanes have their common connections (like the 
data bus) hooked up together to allow them to talk to each other.</p>

<p>The ‘X’ connections consist of the 8-bit data bus, 16-bit address bus (to be 
used by future X cards), 8-bit instruction bus, power connections and finally 
the control signals to load this register. The diagram of the connectors look 
like this:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-12-01-0003.png" alt="Instruction Register Connections" />
  
  <figcaption>Instruction Register Connections (<a href="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-12-01-1003.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This shows the four right angled boxed headers — from left to 
right these are: 10+10 control lines, 8+8 address bus, 8+8 data and 
instruction bus and finally 5+5 power lines. On the control connector the 
lines marked ‘***’ are lines that will be used by future ‘X type’ cards and 
the lines marked ‘—’ are unused/spare. The lines on each connector are as 
follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ctrl-X (Control Line Bus)
    <ul>
      <li>LIN … Instruction Register Load</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A-Bus
    <ul>
      <li>A0-AF … 16-bit Address Bus</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>D/I-Bus (Data Bus + Instruction Bus)
    <ul>
      <li>D0-D7 … 8-bit Data Bus</li>
      <li>I0-I7 … 8-bit Instruction Bus</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, finally, wiring everything together we get the 
following:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-12-01-0004.png" alt="Complete Instruction Register" />
  
  <figcaption>Complete Instruction Register (<a href="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-12-01-1004.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This 
diagram includes everything mentioned so far along with the power supply and 
ground lines and all other internal wiring. As with previous cards, the 
completed instruction register design can be found <a href="/assets/pdf/register-in-1.pdf">here in PDF format</a> (so you can zoom right in on the 
detail).</p>

<p>So, that’s the instruction register all designed and ready 
for construction however as I’ve still not got anywhere suitable for soldering 
in the house just yet that’ll be on hold for a bit. In the meanwhile though 
there’s plenty more cards to design and the next one in line is the decoder. 
This card will take the value on the instruction bus and decode what class of 
instruction that value represents. Following that card I’ll design the 
sequencer and control cards introduced in my last post. When all of that is 
done it’ll finally be time to get constructing and put together these four 
cards which will get the computer to the stage where a single instruction can 
be performed fully by manually pulsing the clock line.</p>
