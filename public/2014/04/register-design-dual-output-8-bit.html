      <p>In the last post I introduced the design for the A/D register card (which as 
its name suggests contains the A and D 8-bit registers). I’m now making a 
start on the design for the B/C register card and although its pretty much the 
same as the A/D card there’s an extra complexity because the B/C registers 
additionally feed the ALU B and C inputs.</p>

<p>For the A and D registers 
I ended up with the following circuit per 8-bit register:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-04-24-0000.png" alt="8-bit Register Design" />
  
  <figcaption>8-bit Register Design (<a href="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-04-24-1000.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this design 
the spare pad on the left of each of the lower relays feeds an LED to show the 
status of each register bit. This pad is isolated from the register bit 
circuitry itself by making use of the second DPDT switch on each bit relay. 
The B and C registers will also need this LED feed but additionally need to 
provide a permanent feed of the current value in each register bit to the ALU. 
However, I can’t just piggyback on the pad used to light the LED because 
there’s a risk that the LEDs could light up in error if anything back feeds up 
the B or C ALU lines (thereby obscuring the actual value held in the 
register). A better solution is to isolate the LED feed from the ALU feed 
however this then requires an extra relay per bit because I’ll then need three 
DPDT switches rather than the two used above. Diagram wise it’d look like 
this:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-04-24-0001.png" alt="8-bit Register Design with additional output" />
  
  <figcaption>8-bit Register Design with additional output (<a href="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-04-24-1001.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this design there is now the required two pads available per 
relay … one for the LED and one for the ALU feed. However, doubling the 
number of relays also means double the current consumption for each bit that’s 
holding a value … double the cost in relays … double the soldering … 
double the frustration etc etc. One way around this would be to stick with the 
single pad design (with one relay per bit) and place a diode in the feed to 
the ALU so that back feed cannot occur. This doesn’t come for ‘free’ though 
and needs some consideration to the effect the diode will have on the ALU feed 
itself.</p>

<p>The first concern would be the voltage drop across a diode. 
Assuming a silicon diode is used the voltage drop would typically be 0.7V and 
so based on a supply of 12V the voltage downstream of the diode would reduce 
to 11.3V. According to the data sheets for the relays I’m using (the TE/Axicom 
V23079-A2003-B301) they’ll be happy with anything down to 9V before they’ll 
refuse to operate so things should be OK here. In fact I could get away with 
three diodes in series (maybe even four at a push) before I’d run in to 
problems.</p>

<p>With the first concern ticked off the next one would be 
over the current flowing through the diode. Each of the relays I’m using 
consumes around 11mA whilst the coil is energised (based on a 12V supply and a 
coil resistance of 1029 ohms … assuming I’ve followed ohms law correctly of 
course ;). A typical signal diode like the 1N4001 can pass up to 100mA before 
it’ll get a sweat on so in theory I could feed 9 relays through the diode 
without problems. This point actually raises a greater issue which I always 
have in the back of mind when designing the various parts of this computer … 
fan out.</p>

<p>Fan out (in the design of this computer at least) is a 
measure of how many relays I can drive from a single output of a single relay 
switch (assuming that switch is fed directly by the power source as it is in 
the above diagrams). The voltage in this case isn’t so much of a concern 
because relays in parallel will receive the same voltage but the current of 
multiple relays will add up and could cause issues. Actually, my worry about 
the max diode current is actually second place to the amount of current the 
wire wrap wire itself is happy passing. This ‘Kynar’ wire is gauged at 30AWG 
and I’m working on the basis that it can carry around 100mA (as a conservative 
estimate). Converting that 100mA to my preferred currency comes out at 9 
relays. Because of this limit I’ve always got a 9 relay fan out limit in my 
head to keep things within limits and in practice most individual outputs 
wouldn’t feed more than a couple of outputs at a time. When manually operating 
the computer it could be possible to do something silly (like load multiple 
registers off the data bus simultaneously) but even then I’m pretty sure 
things would be within limits. Fortunately if I do find anywhere is getting a 
bit ‘hot’ design wise I can always lay down multiple wire wraps between two 
points to increase the current carrying capacity.</p>

<p>Anyho, that’s 
settled, I’ll use a diode to keep the feeds isolated and therefore I can use 
the same ‘one relay per bit’ design used in the A and D registers. I’ll put 
together a full schematic for the B and C registers now and then post them up 
here in due course. Incidentally, in other news my laser cutting has been 
dispatched so should be with me in the next couple of days so I’m not going to 
be able to resist putting that together and posting about it so it’ll probably 
be an enclosure post next followed by a register post.</p>
