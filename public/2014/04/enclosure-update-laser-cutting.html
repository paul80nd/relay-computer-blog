      <p>I couldn’t resist it any longer … I’ve ordered the laser cut parts for the 
case doors, sides and bay floor/ceilings. I did say I’d wait for my chosen 
laser cut website to put out a free delivery offer but I ended up crumbling 
under the weight of my own impatience. Needless to say within 24 hours of 
placing my order they announced a free delivery offer for the end of April … 
c’est la vie and all that jazz.</p>

<p>Oh, and I hope you like pictures 
because this post is a bit of an image-fest.</p>

<p>I covered the design 
of the floor and ceiling panels in my recent post but for the hard of 
searching here’s the cut file for these panels (with cut lines beefed up so 
you can see them better — the original file has the lines set to 0.01mm):</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-04-10-0000.png" alt="Floor and Ceiling Panel Cut" />
  
  <figcaption>Floor and Ceiling Panel Cut (<a href="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-04-10-1000.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As you can 
probably see, there’s eight identical panels which form the four sets of 
ceilings and floors that fit in to each of the card bays. Here’s a SketchUp 
rendering again of how one of those bays will end up looking:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-04-10-0001.png" alt="Card Bay Rendering" />
  
</figure>

<p>I’ve chosen to 
cut these out of 3mm laser grade plywood as the material is reasonably priced 
and has good strength. Before I ordered the cut I printed out a paper version 
first (always recommended when doing laser cutting) and set at it with the 
scissors to check everything was OK:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-04-10-0002.JPG" alt="Paper card bay floor with guides" />
  
</figure>

<p>… 
and this is the same sat in the enclosure as it currently stands:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-04-10-0003.JPG" alt="Paper template sat in enclosure" />
  
</figure>

<p>I 
should probably mention, for those of you who fancy lasering up some wood, I’m 
using <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.razorlab.co.uk/">RazorLab</a> for 
all my cutting. I believe they’re the UK agent for 
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ponoko.com/">Ponoko</a> - or at least I’m 
pretty sure they’re white labelling the Ponoko software. The whole process is 
fairly straightforward given the technical nature of laser cutting and prices 
seem relatively reasonable … well, until you add delivery and the 20% UK 
sales tax / VAT on top of the final price of course. RazorLab have a good 
section on their website showing samples of cuts and etching on their 
available materials … this is the 
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.razorlab.co.uk/materials/info/?id=169">3mm plywood</a> 
I’m using for the above. Each material comes in three sizes P1, P2 
and P3, the largest, which is 790x384 mm (31.1x15.1 in) and it’s the P3 size 
I’m using for the above.</p>

<p>Now, what’s better than lasering one sheet 
of material? Lasering up three sheets of course. In addition to the floors and 
ceilings I also need to put in some sides to the enclosure and also add panels 
to the front and back door. These are going be made from 
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.razorlab.co.uk/materials/info/?id=179">smoked acrylic/Perspex</a> 
so you’ll be able to see the LEDs flashing away inside 
when the doors are closed. This is the look I’m aiming for:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-04-10-0004.png" alt="Full enclosure render" />
  
</figure>

<p>Fortunately the 
front and back door panels fit within the P3 material size although there’s 
quite a bit of wastage left over so I’ve cut some extra panels out (which I’ll 
come back to later in this post). Here’s the cut file (again with lines 
fattened up):</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-04-10-0005.png" alt="Cut file for front and back doors" />
  
  <figcaption>Cut file for front and back doors (<a href="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-04-10-1001.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The 
main panels above have a bit of a perculiarity on the corners due to the 
corner brackets of the aluminium frame eating into the groove the panel sits 
in. Close up it looks like this:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-04-10-0006.png" alt="Front/Back panel corner detail" />
  
</figure>

<p>The other two smaller panels on 
this cut file don’t need this ‘toothed’ edge and so have simple rounded 
corners. You may have noticed everything in this cut file has small rounded 
corners and that’s because acrylic doesn’t suffer sharp corners well and can 
crack if placed under stress — the round corners help spread the stresses 
around a bit.</p>

<p>For the sides of the enclosure there’s one final cut 
file designed for the P2 size:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-04-10-0007.png" alt="Panel sides cut file" />
  
  <figcaption>Panel sides cut file (<a href="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-04-10-1002.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Oo - what’s that 
at the bottom ;) Well, again, the panel sides didn’t quite use enough of the 
P2 material so I cut some ‘extra’ bits. This and the 2 extra bits from the P3 
cut go in to the next ‘phase’ of the enclosure. Normally I wouldn’t want to 
commit to making something until I’ve got the design to a reasonable stage but 
it was better to cut something and throw it away than to receive a useless 
piece of acrylic. Now, this bit is still very much in the design stage but 
here’s what I’ve got in SketchUp so far:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-04-10-0008.png" alt="Full enclosure beta design" />
  
</figure>

<p>The 
additional cut panels from the P3 will go in the sides of the upper enclosure 
(assuming it stays the same size) and the extra from the P2 cut is for the 
main switch panel … here’s a close up of the cut:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-04-10-0009.png" alt="Switch panel cut file close up" />
  
</figure>

<p>… and 
a close up of the panel in the rendering …</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-04-10-0010.png" alt="Switch panel rendering (close up)" />
  
  <figcaption>Switch panel rendering (close up) (<a href="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-04-10-1003.png">larger</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The 
eagle eyed out there may notice the rendering and cut have the right hand 
switches out of order and the labelling is slightly different … this is due 
to my last minute design changes before ordering the cut. This main switch 
panel will always be visible even when the doors are closed and is the main 
method of controlling the computer. I’ll run through what each of these 
switches does at a later point (unless anyone really, really wants to know now 
of course ;) but in the meanwhile here’s a picture of said switches:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-04-10-0011.jpg" alt="Main switches" />
  
</figure>

<p>… and really nice 
chunky things they are too with a great click sound and feel. For anyone who’s 
curious these are the (catchily titled) M2012TNW01-HA by NKK switches. One 
last thing about the top enclosure … there’s two boards immediately above 
the switch panel … these are for … actually … I’ll save that for another 
time ;P</p>

<p>Anyho, that’s enough for now. The material has been 
reserved for my order and it’s now ready to be cut so hopefully within the 
next week or so I should be able to post pictures of all the cut panels and 
show them fitted to the enclosure. Incidentally although it probably looks 
like I’m taking a bit of a short break from the internals of the computer to 
indulge myself in the enclosure I’ve been busy putting the AD and BC register 
schematics together so I’ll no doubt post about them in the not too distant 
future.</p>
