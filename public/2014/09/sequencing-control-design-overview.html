      <p>I’ve now got my computer to a state where I can perform ALU operations 
and push values around the four registers by manually operating the various 
control lines. It’s time to move things on a bit now and work towards getting 
the computer to the point where given a specific instruction/op-code it can 
operate the control lines itself without further input from the user. 
Eventually the computer will be given a list of instructions to perform which 
it’ll work through step by step but for now the next milestone is to automate 
the operation of a single instruction.</p>

<p>In my recent videos I’ve 
been demonstrating, by hand, the processing of a simple arithmetic sequence on 
the computer by following a list of instructions represented as a set of 
mnemonics. Here’s a screenshot from the video showing the full set of 
mnemonics/instructions to perform the calculation of (((2 + 4 + 1) x 3) - 
3):</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-09-19-0000.png" alt="Arithmetic Sequence Mnemonics" />
  
</figure>

<p>Here’s a 
description of the mnemonics used in this calculation:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Mnemonic Form</th>
      <th>Instruction Class</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>LDI </code><em><code>r</code></em><code>,</code><em><code>v</code></em></td>
      <td>Load Immediate</td>
      <td>Loads the value <em>v</em> in to register <em>r</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>MOV </code><em><code>s</code></em><code>,</code><em><code>d</code></em></td>
      <td>8-bit Move</td>
      <td>Copies the value in register <em>s</em> to register <em>d</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ADD</code></td>
      <td>Add</td>
      <td>Performs an ALU ADD operation placing the result in register A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>INC</code></td>
      <td>Increment</td>
      <td>Performs an ALU INC operation placing the result in register A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>NOT</code></td>
      <td>Logic Not</td>
      <td>Performs an ALU NOT operation placing the result in the register A</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>One thing I should mention here is that although these mnemonics 
are fairly common I’ve introduced a bit of an inconsistency with the MOV 
instruction which should really have the destination parameter first followed 
by the source parameter so that it matches the LDI instruction. Some assembly 
languages have source first then destination, some have it the other way 
around but all instructions should at least be consistent. Eventually I’ll 
slip this change in so that the instruction will become MOV d,s.</p>

<p>There is, of course, other operations the ALU can perform and the mnemonics 
for these would be:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Mnemonic Form</th>
      <th>Instruction Class</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>AND</code></td>
      <td>Logic And</td>
      <td>Performs an ALU AND operation placing the result in register A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ORR</code></td>
      <td>Logic Or</td>
      <td>Performs an ALU OR operation placing the result in register A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>XOR</code></td>
      <td>Logic Exclusive Or</td>
      <td>Performs an ALU XOR operation placing the result in register A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>SHL</code></td>
      <td>Bitwise Shift Left</td>
      <td>Performs an ALU SHL operation placing the result in register A</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Although all the ALU operations 
shown here place their result in register A by default you can optionally 
specify either register A or D, as a parameter, to change where the result is 
placed. All of the ALU operations also load the condition register whilst the 
result is on the data bus.</p>

<p>The mnemonics shown above are, as the 
name suggests, a handy way to remember the underlying 8-bit opcode (binary 
instruction) that the computer understands and can operate from. The mnemonics 
introduced so far fall in to three broad classes: ALU, SETAB (Load Immediate) 
and 8-bit MOVE operations. The opcodes are as follows:</p>

<p>Designing these opcodes is 
all about fitting enough options in to the bits available whilst still being 
able to distinguish one instruction class from another. As you can see above, 
any instruction starting with 1000 must be for the ALU whereas any starting 
with 00 must be about moving (or more precisely, copying) data between 
registers. As MOV-8 instructions only use two bits to identify that class of 
instruction there’s enough room to allow the selection of eight different 
registers for both source and destination. In contrast, the ALU only needs 
three bits to pick the ALU operation to perform so it’s then a toss up between 
having more instruction classes or limiting the destination where the ALU 
result can be placed (in this case 1 bit is used for the destination parameter 
and four are used to identify the class of instruction).</p>

<p>There 
will, of course, be more instruction classes to come in time but for now the 
ALU, SETAB and MOV-8 are the ones I’m going to concentrate on. Before I go any 
further I should mention that the instruction set I’m using is directly based 
on that used in the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/Relay/index.html">relay computer by Dr Harry Porter</a> which was then expanded 
on by Phil Ryals at the Goodwill Computer Museum on the

<p>Each mnemonic I use has an exact opcode equivalent 
and some examples of these are listed below (effectively a list of all the 
unique mnemonics used in the arithmetic sequence at the top of this post). 
Once the computer is complete I will generally write programs for execution as 
a list of mnemonics (which are easier for me to remember) which can then be 
‘assembled’ line by line in to a list of opcodes (which are something the 
computer can work with).</p>

<pre><code>LDI B,2   [SETAB]   01100010
LDI B,3   [SETAB]   01100011
LDI A,4   [SETAB]   01000100
ADD       [ALU]     10000001
INC       [ALU]     10000010
INC D     [ALU]     10001010
NOT D     [ALU]     10001110
MOV A,B   [MOV-8]   00001000
MOV A,C   [MOV-8]   00010000
MOV D,B   [MOV-8]   00001011
MOV D,C   [MOV-8]   00010011
</code></pre>

<p>Now, again, I’ve 
messed up a bit again in the mnemonics I’ve used for that arithmetic sequence 
… I’ve used a LDI C,4 which actually doesn’t have an opcode equivalent 
because the SETAB class of instruction can only load the A or B register (not 
C). I can resolve this by loading the value in to register A with a LDI A,4 
and then copy the value in to register C with a MOV-8 class of instruction.</p>

<p>So, as far as designing cards for the computer to handle the 
processing of these opcodes goes the first jobs are to store the instruction 
and then decide which class of instruction it represents. Storing the 
instruction is easy enough and is achieved by adding another 8-bit register 
which can be loaded from the data bus. This ‘instruction register’ is pretty 
similar to the general purpose registers introduced so far but has its current 
value hard wired to the decoder and control circuits. The decoding circuit is 
also quite simple and should need only around five relays to handle the logic 
of deciphering the instruction class from the higher five bits of the 
instruction code. For the instruction classes introduced so far (SETAB, ALU 
and MOV-8) that logic is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SETAB <br />
Bit 7 off, bit 6 on (01xxxxxx)</li>
  <li>ALU <br />
Bit 7 on, bits 6 thru 4 off (1000xxxx)</li>
  <li>MOV-8 <br />
Bits 7 and 6 off (00xxxxxx)</li>
</ul>

<p>This will 
all be implemented on a new ‘decoder’ card. This card will be fairly barren 
given how few relays are required to handle the decoding logic but none of the 
other cards will really have enough spare space so c’est la vie and all 
that.</p>

<p>Now that we have the instruction code in hand and can work 
out which class the code belongs to the next job is to operate the appropriate 
control lines in sequence. For each instruction class these are the steps to 
take:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SETAB
    <ul>
      <li>Select ‘Immediate-to-bus’ (value on primary switches) and whilst keeping selected:
        <ul>
          <li>Load either register A or B</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ALU
    <ul>
      <li>Set ALU function code and while keeping code set:
        <ul>
          <li>Load either register A or D and</li>
          <li>Load condition register</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>MOV-8
    <ul>
      <li>Select source register and whilst keeping register selected:
        <ul>
          <li>Load destination register</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Visualising these as timing diagrams 
we get the following:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-09-19-0001.png" alt="Basic timing diagrams for instructions" />
  
</figure>

<p>As can be seen in the diagram above the value being copied (or 
calculated for the ALU) is kept on the data bus longer than it is loaded in to 
the destination registers. This is to allow the value to ‘settle’ on the data 
bus and avoids issues where the source relays may turn off quicker than the 
destination relays hence loosing the desired value. All mechanical switches 
also suffer from an issue known as ‘bounce’ where the contacts connect and 
disconnect rapidly before settling down when set on and this is also what the 
overlap allows for.</p>

<p>Although these timing diagrams look quite 
simple there’s actually quite a lot of infrastructure required to produce 
these in a relay computer. You can probably see from the diagram that there is 
three distinct shapes of pulses … the single pulse used in all three 
commands, the double pulse in the MOV command and finally the triple pulse in 
the SETAB and ALU commands. How can these be produced? Well, we need to start 
with something quite simple … a heartbeat that the entire computer will run 
from.</p>

<p>That heartbeat is known as a ‘clock’ and it produces a steady 
on/off train of pulses that can then be combined and have simple logic gates 
applied over to get the desired timing signals. My computer will actually have 
two clocks … one which is made out of a chain of relays and capacitors to 
make an electromechanical clock that runs at a fixed rate and a second one 
that uses the popular 555 timing IC that will be variable. The former clock is 
more ‘in keeping’ with the design of a relay computer but I wanted to be able 
to switch over to a variable clock that has the flexibility of speeding the 
computer up or down as required/desired. Also the variable clock will be far 
quieter than the ‘chattering’ fixed clock which again further aids the choice 
between authenticity and practicality (the rest of the computer will then, of 
course, still happily click away without being drowned out by the clock 
relays).  Either way the timing diagram for the clock will always look as 
follows (with evenly timed on and off periods) regardless of relay/IC 
selection:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-09-19-0002.png" alt="Clock Pulses" />
  
</figure>

<p>The first step in using 
these clock pulses is to achieve a sense of state in the computer. Effectively 
we need to count the clock pulses so we can tell if we’re at the beginning, 
middle or end of an instruction. This is implemented using a Finite State 
Machine (FSM) which will effectively count up the clock pulses reseting at 
predetermined points (when the instruction is complete). Eventually the FSM 
will count up to a maximum of 23 for the more complex instructions and will be 
resettable at stage 8, 10, 12 and 14 for instructions that require less steps. 
The SETAB, ALU and MOV-8 instructions can all be handled within 8 steps so for 
now we’ll stick with an 8 step FSM.</p>

<p>The FSM gives out a series of 
pulses according to the step it is currently on. For each step there is 
typically a pulse that lasts a single clock cycle and one that lasts two. This 
will come in useful later when combining these pulses to avoid any gaps in the 
resulting pulse that could cause erratic behaviour. The timing diagrams for 
the first eight steps is as follows:</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-09-19-0003.png" alt="Finite State Machine pulses" />
  
</figure>

<p>Given these 
outputs from the FSM we can now apply the following logic to derive those 
three pulses needed to implement the MOV-8, SETAB and ALU instructions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>P-C (Pulse C)
    <ul>
      <li>S5</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>P-D (Pulse D)
    <ul>
      <li>~S5</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>P-E (Pulse E)
    <ul>
      <li>S4 or S5</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Shown as a timing diagram these pulses combinations look like 
this:</p>
<figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-09-19-0004.png" alt="Sequenced Pulses" />
  
</figure>

<p>Now, this diagram 
probably raises more questions than it answers. Firstly, why is the first 
pulse named ‘P-C’ … surely there is a ‘P-A’ and ‘P-B’ … there is indeed 
and these will be used later on to load and increment the program counter and 
to load the current instruction from memory in to the instruction register. 
This is also why the C, D and E pulses are based on state 4 and 5 on the FSM 
because the earlier states drive the preparation of the instruction 
register.</p>

<p>Implementation wise the FSM and sequencing pulses will be 
handled on a pair of sequencer cards which will take the clock pulse and 
generate a full set of sequence pulses. Again, for now, I’ll only be 
concentrating on producing P-C, P-D and P-E but eventually there’ll be a full 
range of pulses to implement all the various instructions the computer will be 
capable of performing.</p>

<p>So, with the sequencing pulses and operation 
class in hand it’s now just a case of implementing fairly simple relay logic 
gates to direct these pulses to the appropriate control lines at the right 
time. This will take place on the ‘control’ card and as with the other cards 
this will eventually handle the direction of the full set of pulses to the 
right control lines for all instructions.</p>

<p>That’s pretty much it for 
sequencing and control in theory. The next step now is to begin designing the 
cards that will make all this a reality for the MOV-8, ALU and SETAB 
instructions. These cards will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Instruction Register
    <ul>
      <li>Storage of 8-bit instruction</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Decoder
    <ul>
      <li>Classification of 8-bit instruction (MOV-8, ALU or SETAB)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sequencer
    <ul>
      <li>FSM and sequencing pulse production</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Control
    <ul>
      <li>Activation of control lines based on instruction class and sequencing pulses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For the moment I can get away without the clock card as I 
can manually produce the clock pulses using the ‘CLK’ toggle switch on the 
computer front panel but once everything is looking good and working that’ll 
be the next card to create.</p>

<p>In my next post I’ll cover the design 
of the instruction register and following that I’ll run through the design of 
each of the cards listed above. Once all four cards are designed I can get on 
with the construction and testing … all being well this will coincide with 
my new house having all the decorating and so on complete and I’ll have 
somewhere to actually get on with constructing the cards.</p>
