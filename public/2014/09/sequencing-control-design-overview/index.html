          <p>I&rsquo;ve now got my computer to a state where I can perform ALU operations
and push values around the four registers by manually operating the various
control lines. It&rsquo;s time to move things on a bit now and work towards getting
the computer to the point where given a specific instruction/op-code it can
operate the control lines itself without further input from the user.
Eventually the computer will be given a list of instructions to perform which
it&rsquo;ll work through step by step but for now the next milestone is to automate
the operation of a single instruction.</p>
<p>In my recent videos I&rsquo;ve
been demonstrating, by hand, the processing of a simple arithmetic sequence on
the computer by following a list of instructions represented as a set of
mnemonics. Here&rsquo;s a screenshot from the video showing the full set of
mnemonics/instructions to perform the calculation of (((2 + 4 + 1) x 3) -
3):</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-09-19-0000.png" alt="Arithmetic Sequence Mnemonics">
  
</figure>


<p>Here&rsquo;s a
description of the mnemonics used in this calculation:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Mnemonic Form</th>
<th>Instruction Class</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>LDI </code><em><code>r</code></em><code>,</code><em><code>v</code></em></td>
<td>Load Immediate</td>
<td>Loads the value <em>v</em> in to register <em>r</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>MOV </code><em><code>s</code></em><code>,</code><em><code>d</code></em></td>
<td>8-bit Move</td>
<td>Copies the value in register <em>s</em> to register <em>d</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>ADD</code></td>
<td>Add</td>
<td>Performs an ALU ADD operation placing the result in register A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>INC</code></td>
<td>Increment</td>
<td>Performs an ALU INC operation placing the result in register A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>NOT</code></td>
<td>Logic Not</td>
<td>Performs an ALU NOT operation placing the result in the register A</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>One thing I should mention here is that although these mnemonics
are fairly common I&rsquo;ve introduced a bit of an inconsistency with the MOV
instruction which should really have the destination parameter first followed
by the source parameter so that it matches the LDI instruction. Some assembly
languages have source first then destination, some have it the other way
around but all instructions should at least be consistent. Eventually I&rsquo;ll
slip this change in so that the instruction will become MOV d,s.</p>
<p>There is, of course, other operations the ALU can perform and the mnemonics
for these would be:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Mnemonic Form</th>
<th>Instruction Class</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>AND</code></td>
<td>Logic And</td>
<td>Performs an ALU AND operation placing the result in register A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>ORR</code></td>
<td>Logic Or</td>
<td>Performs an ALU OR operation placing the result in register A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>XOR</code></td>
<td>Logic Exclusive Or</td>
<td>Performs an ALU XOR operation placing the result in register A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>SHL</code></td>
<td>Bitwise Shift Left</td>
<td>Performs an ALU SHL operation placing the result in register A</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Although all the ALU operations
shown here place their result in register A by default you can optionally
specify either register A or D, as a parameter, to change where the result is
placed. All of the ALU operations also load the condition register whilst the
result is on the data bus.</p>
<p>The mnemonics shown above are, as the
name suggests, a handy way to remember the underlying 8-bit opcode (binary
instruction) that the computer understands and can operate from. The mnemonics
introduced so far fall in to three broad classes: ALU, SETAB (Load Immediate)
and 8-bit MOVE operations. The opcodes are as follows:</p>

</p>
<p>Designing these opcodes is
all about fitting enough options in to the bits available whilst still being
able to distinguish one instruction class from another. As you can see above,
any instruction starting with 1000 must be for the ALU whereas any starting
with 00 must be about moving (or more precisely, copying) data between
registers. As MOV-8 instructions only use two bits to identify that class of
instruction there&rsquo;s enough room to allow the selection of eight different
registers for both source and destination. In contrast, the ALU only needs
three bits to pick the ALU operation to perform so it&rsquo;s then a toss up between
having more instruction classes or limiting the destination where the ALU
result can be placed (in this case 1 bit is used for the destination parameter
and four are used to identify the class of instruction).</p>
<p>There
will, of course, be more instruction classes to come in time but for now the
ALU, SETAB and MOV-8 are the ones I&rsquo;m going to concentrate on. Before I go any
further I should mention that the instruction set I&rsquo;m using is directly based
on that used in the <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/Relay/index.html">relay computer by Dr Harry Porter</a> which was then expanded
on by Phil Ryals at the Goodwill Computer Museum on the
<a href="http://www.computerculture.org/projects/rc3/">RC-3 relay computer</a>.</p>
<p>Each mnemonic I use has an exact opcode equivalent
and some examples of these are listed below (effectively a list of all the
unique mnemonics used in the arithmetic sequence at the top of this post).
Once the computer is complete I will generally write programs for execution as
a list of mnemonics (which are easier for me to remember) which can then be
&lsquo;assembled&rsquo; line by line in to a list of opcodes (which are something the
computer can work with).</p>
<pre><code>LDI B,2   [SETAB]   01100010
LDI B,3   [SETAB]   01100011
LDI A,4   [SETAB]   01000100
ADD       [ALU]     10000001
INC       [ALU]     10000010
INC D     [ALU]     10001010
NOT D     [ALU]     10001110
MOV A,B   [MOV-8]   00001000
MOV A,C   [MOV-8]   00010000
MOV D,B   [MOV-8]   00001011
MOV D,C   [MOV-8]   00010011
</code></pre>
<p>Now, again, I&rsquo;ve
messed up a bit again in the mnemonics I&rsquo;ve used for that arithmetic sequence
&hellip; I&rsquo;ve used a LDI C,4 which actually doesn&rsquo;t have an opcode equivalent
because the SETAB class of instruction can only load the A or B register (not
C). I can resolve this by loading the value in to register A with a LDI A,4
and then copy the value in to register C with a MOV-8 class of instruction.</p>
<p>So, as far as designing cards for the computer to handle the
processing of these opcodes goes the first jobs are to store the instruction
and then decide which class of instruction it represents. Storing the
instruction is easy enough and is achieved by adding another 8-bit register
which can be loaded from the data bus. This &lsquo;instruction register&rsquo; is pretty
similar to the general purpose registers introduced so far but has its current
value hard wired to the decoder and control circuits. The decoding circuit is
also quite simple and should need only around five relays to handle the logic
of deciphering the instruction class from the higher five bits of the
instruction code. For the instruction classes introduced so far (SETAB, ALU
and MOV-8) that logic is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>SETAB \
Bit 7 off, bit 6 on (01xxxxxx)</li>
<li>ALU \
Bit 7 on, bits 6 thru 4 off (1000xxxx)</li>
<li>MOV-8 \
Bits 7 and 6 off (00xxxxxx)</li>
</ul>
<p>This will
all be implemented on a new &lsquo;decoder&rsquo; card. This card will be fairly barren
given how few relays are required to handle the decoding logic but none of the
other cards will really have enough spare space so c&rsquo;est la vie and all
that.</p>
<p>Now that we have the instruction code in hand and can work
out which class the code belongs to the next job is to operate the appropriate
control lines in sequence. For each instruction class these are the steps to
take:</p>
<ul>
<li>SETAB
<ul>
<li>Select &lsquo;Immediate-to-bus&rsquo; (value on primary switches) and whilst keeping selected:
<ul>
<li>Load either register A or B</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ALU
<ul>
<li>Set ALU function code and while keeping code set:
<ul>
<li>Load either register A or D and</li>
<li>Load condition register</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MOV-8
<ul>
<li>Select source register and whilst keeping register selected:
<ul>
<li>Load destination register</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Visualising these as timing diagrams
we get the following:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-09-19-0001.png" alt="Basic timing diagrams for instructions">
  
</figure>


<p>As can be seen in the diagram above the value being copied (or
calculated for the ALU) is kept on the data bus longer than it is loaded in to
the destination registers. This is to allow the value to &lsquo;settle&rsquo; on the data
bus and avoids issues where the source relays may turn off quicker than the
destination relays hence loosing the desired value. All mechanical switches
also suffer from an issue known as &lsquo;bounce&rsquo; where the contacts connect and
disconnect rapidly before settling down when set on and this is also what the
overlap allows for.</p>
<p>Although these timing diagrams look quite
simple there&rsquo;s actually quite a lot of infrastructure required to produce
these in a relay computer. You can probably see from the diagram that there is
three distinct shapes of pulses &hellip; the single pulse used in all three
commands, the double pulse in the MOV command and finally the triple pulse in
the SETAB and ALU commands. How can these be produced? Well, we need to start
with something quite simple &hellip; a heartbeat that the entire computer will run
from.</p>
<p>That heartbeat is known as a &lsquo;clock&rsquo; and it produces a steady
on/off train of pulses that can then be combined and have simple logic gates
applied over to get the desired timing signals. My computer will actually have
two clocks &hellip; one which is made out of a chain of relays and capacitors to
make an electromechanical clock that runs at a fixed rate and a second one
that uses the popular 555 timing IC that will be variable. The former clock is
more &lsquo;in keeping&rsquo; with the design of a relay computer but I wanted to be able
to switch over to a variable clock that has the flexibility of speeding the
computer up or down as required/desired. Also the variable clock will be far
quieter than the &lsquo;chattering&rsquo; fixed clock which again further aids the choice
between authenticity and practicality (the rest of the computer will then, of
course, still happily click away without being drowned out by the clock
relays).  Either way the timing diagram for the clock will always look as
follows (with evenly timed on and off periods) regardless of relay/IC
selection:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-09-19-0002.png" alt="Clock Pulses">
  
</figure>


<p>The first step in using
these clock pulses is to achieve a sense of state in the computer. Effectively
we need to count the clock pulses so we can tell if we&rsquo;re at the beginning,
middle or end of an instruction. This is implemented using a Finite State
Machine (FSM) which will effectively count up the clock pulses reseting at
predetermined points (when the instruction is complete). Eventually the FSM
will count up to a maximum of 23 for the more complex instructions and will be
resettable at stage 8, 10, 12 and 14 for instructions that require less steps.
The SETAB, ALU and MOV-8 instructions can all be handled within 8 steps so for
now we&rsquo;ll stick with an 8 step FSM.</p>
<p>The FSM gives out a series of
pulses according to the step it is currently on. For each step there is
typically a pulse that lasts a single clock cycle and one that lasts two. This
will come in useful later when combining these pulses to avoid any gaps in the
resulting pulse that could cause erratic behaviour. The timing diagrams for
the first eight steps is as follows:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-09-19-0003.png" alt="Finite State Machine pulses">
  
</figure>


<p>Given these
outputs from the FSM we can now apply the following logic to derive those
three pulses needed to implement the MOV-8, SETAB and ALU instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>P-C (Pulse C)
<ul>
<li>S5</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>P-D (Pulse D)
<ul>
<li>~S5</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>P-E (Pulse E)
<ul>
<li>S4 or S5</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Shown as a timing diagram these pulses combinations look like
this:
<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/2014/2014-09-19-0004.png" alt="Sequenced Pulses">
  
</figure>

</p>
<p>Now, this diagram
probably raises more questions than it answers. Firstly, why is the first
pulse named &lsquo;P-C&rsquo; &hellip; surely there is a &lsquo;P-A&rsquo; and &lsquo;P-B&rsquo; &hellip; there is indeed
and these will be used later on to load and increment the program counter and
to load the current instruction from memory in to the instruction register.
This is also why the C, D and E pulses are based on state 4 and 5 on the FSM
because the earlier states drive the preparation of the instruction
register.</p>
<p>Implementation wise the FSM and sequencing pulses will be
handled on a pair of sequencer cards which will take the clock pulse and
generate a full set of sequence pulses. Again, for now, I&rsquo;ll only be
concentrating on producing P-C, P-D and P-E but eventually there&rsquo;ll be a full
range of pulses to implement all the various instructions the computer will be
capable of performing.</p>
<p>So, with the sequencing pulses and operation
class in hand it&rsquo;s now just a case of implementing fairly simple relay logic
gates to direct these pulses to the appropriate control lines at the right
time. This will take place on the &lsquo;control&rsquo; card and as with the other cards
this will eventually handle the direction of the full set of pulses to the
right control lines for all instructions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much it for
sequencing and control in theory. The next step now is to begin designing the
cards that will make all this a reality for the MOV-8, ALU and SETAB
instructions. These cards will be:</p>

<p>For the moment I can get away without the clock card as I
can manually produce the clock pulses using the &lsquo;CLK&rsquo; toggle switch on the
computer front panel but once everything is looking good and working that&rsquo;ll
be the next card to create.</p>
<p>In my next post I&rsquo;ll cover the design
of the instruction register and following that I&rsquo;ll run through the design of
each of the cards listed above. Once all four cards are designed I can get on
with the construction and testing &hellip; all being well this will coincide with
my new house having all the decorating and so on complete and I&rsquo;ll have
somewhere to actually get on with constructing the cards.</p>
