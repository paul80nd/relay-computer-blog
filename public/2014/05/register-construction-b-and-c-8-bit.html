      <p>As mentioned in my last post I decided this time around not to post 
after each stage of card construction (being as the construction steps are now 
pretty similar to those for previous cards). In line with that decision this 
post covers all the steps taken to construct the B/C register card … 
primarily in photos and then with extra text where anything odd or different 
came up compared with the other cards completed so far.</p>

<p>The first 
step was to solder down the LEDs, ribbon cable sockets, relay sockets and 
finally the wire wrapping posts. Here’s some pictures, front and back, of the 
card following this round of soldering:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-05-24-0000.jpg" alt="B/C Register Card with initial soldering completed (back)" />
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-05-24-0001.jpg" alt="B/C Register Card with initial soldering completed (front)" />
  
</figure>

<p>I made a few tweaks to the construction method on this 
card. Firstly I applied a line of super glue to the board when placing the 
LEDs to stop them moving about while soldering and this has kept them more or 
less pointing forward. Also with the LEDs I’ve removed the negative wrapping 
post behind each LED to make wiring up easier later on (and to avoid shorts 
when testing around the LEDs). As usual I’ve still not found a nice neat way 
of soldering up the cathodes on the LEDs so this card looks a bit of a pig’s 
ear as always.</p>

<p>This time I’ve also made a small change to the 
layout of the relay sockets. On previous cards I’ve used three sets of triple 
pin sockets laid out in a ‘U’ shape. This has always been a bit fiddly and 
time consuming so I’ve simplified things this time by just having two rows of 
five pin sockets. The same relays will still be used but whereas before the 
bottom middle socket position was unused/unconnected now the two positions one 
up from the bottom on the left and right are unused. This means wasting one 
extra socket per relay from the strip of 32 (and those turned pin sockets 
aren’t cheap) but it saves loads of time and frustration when soldering the 
sockets down.</p>

<p>This card also has extra diodes (in addition to the 
usual ‘flyback’ diodes over the relay coil) to stop back feed on the B and C 
bus lines. At the end of each of these back feed diodes is a single wire wrap 
post. These were particularly tricky to solder down and so some of these are a 
bit wonky … the posts tended to get wonkier as my finger got progressively 
more burnt. I think in future I’ll try and ensure I always solder these posts 
down in pairs (like the ones up the middle of the card) so I can hold the part 
in place from one side whilst solder tacking the other side down.</p>

<p>Here’s a picture of the LEDs viewed from the front:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-05-24-0002.jpg" alt="B/C Register Card LEDs" />
  
</figure>

<p>The left ten 
LEDs are for register B and the right ten for register C. Each have the same 
read-out with the left most LED showing when the register is being loaded 
(yellow) and then the next showing when the register is being selected (green) 
and then the following eight LEDs show bits 7 down to 0 (in that order).</p>

<p>The next stage of construction was soldering down the power and ground 
lines on the solder side of the board:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-05-24-0003.jpg" alt="B/C Register Card with power and ground lines completed" />
  
</figure>

<p>This stage was pretty much consistent with previous cards 
so nothing new to mention here other than I had to skirt around the messy 
soldering on the LED cathodes to avoid any shorts (this is particularly 
evident on the photo above at the bottom left where the black wire curves 
upwards).</p>

<p>With all the soldering done the final steps are to lay 
down all the wire wraps. This is done in stages by laying down each family of 
related connections then laying the next family on top of that. Here’s four 
pictures of the wraps building up over time:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-05-24-0004.jpg" alt="B/C Register Card wire wraps stage 1" />
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-05-24-0005.jpg" alt="B/C Register Card wire wraps stage 2" />
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-05-24-0006.jpg" alt="B/C Register Card wire wraps stage 3" />
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-05-24-0007.jpg" alt="B/C Register Card wire wraps stage 4" />
  
</figure>

<p>The top left picture shows the first three wraps: the black 
internal connections, the red power connections and blue data bus in/out 
connections. The top right picture shows the next two wraps: the black LED 
connections and green internal result connections. The bottom left picture 
shows the next wrap which is the yellow control connections and finally the 
bottom right picture shows the final wrap which is the blue B and C data 
connections.</p>

<p>Finally here is three close up pictures of the final 
wire wraps:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-05-24-0008.jpg" alt="B/C Register Card (left)" />
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-05-24-0009.jpg" alt="B/C Register Card (middle)" />
  <img src="/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-05-24-0010.jpg" alt="B/C Register Card (right)" />
  
</figure>

<p>That’s it for 
the main construction of this card … all I need to do now is pop in the 
relays and then give it a try. I’ll cover testing the card in my next post and 
as usual I’ll put up a video showing the card working but also I’ll show the 
card placed in the enclosure and connected to all the cards constructed so 
far.</p>
