title: Instructions
---

The computer is controlled by a series of instructions held in memory (a computer program) that are loaded into the instruction register one at a time and executed. Each instruction is formed of an 8-bit 'op-code' and falls in to a class of
related instructions (identifiable by the leading part of the op-code).

The list of available instructions is as follows:

{% include pages-instruction.html instruction="ALU" %}
{% include pages-instruction.html instruction="GOTO" %}
{% include pages-instruction.html instruction="MOV8" %}
{% include pages-instruction.html instruction="SETAB" %}

There's also a video summary (as at Jan 2020) of the available instructions:

{% include youtube-player.html id="szvNLpovAGM" %}
