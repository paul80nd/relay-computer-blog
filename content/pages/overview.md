This blog documents my journey in constructing an 8-bit relay computer, from scratch, made from tons of solder, wires,
lights, relays, sweat, tears, swearing and money.

The design of the computer is based on the one constructed by
[Dr. Harry Porter](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/Relay/index.html)
at Portland State University (reproduced on this blog with kind permission) but the construction method is my own and so
this blog captures the thoughts, experiences and pitfalls that I encounter along the way.

For more information about the 'whys and wherefores' of building a computer of this type these posts are a good starting place:

An overview of the architecture used in this relay computer can be found in the following posts:
