title: "Incrementer"
---

The incrementer card can take an input from the address bus and increment it by one placing
the result in the increment register. This is primarily used to increment to program counter
but also can increment the [XY register]({{< relref "/cards/register-xy" >}}) too. 

The incrementer makes up the broader 
['control unit']({{< relref "/pages/control" >}}) within the computer.
