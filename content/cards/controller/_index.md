The role of the controller card is to operate the various control lines of the computer
at the right time according to the current instruction class. It makes up a key part of the broader
['control unit']({{< relref "/pages/control" >}}) within the computer. It is primarily driven
by the [sequencer card]({{< relref "/cards/sequencer">}}) to known 'when' something should happen.
