title: "Decoder"
---

The decoder card takes its input from the instruction bus and decides which class of
instruction the input represents. This is then used by the
[controller]({{< relref "/cards/controller">}}) and
[sequencer]({{< relref "/cards/sequencer">}}) cards in order to perform their tasks.
The decoder card makes up part of the broader
['control unit']({{< relref "/pages/control" >}}) within the computer.
