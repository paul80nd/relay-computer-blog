The XY Register is one of the [general purpose registers]({{< relref "/pages/registers">}}) within the relay computer. It can hold two 8-bit values and can read and write from/to the data bus. Additionally it can also read and write a 16-bit value from/to the address bus combining the X and Y 8-bit registers together.
