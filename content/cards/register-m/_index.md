The M Register is one of the [general purpose registers]({{< relref "/pages/registers">}}) within the relay computer. It can hold two 8-bit values (M1 and M2) and can read and write from/to the data bus. Additionally it can also write (but not read) a 16-bit value to the address bus combining the M1 and M2 8-bit registers together.
