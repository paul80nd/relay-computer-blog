title: "Sequencer"

The sequencer card is effectively a Finite State Machine (FSM) and makes up the broader 
['control unit']({{< relref "/pages/control" >}}) within the computer. This card's role
is to produce a series of pulses at specified times that the 
[controller card]({{< relref "/cards/controller">}}) can then use to operate the various
control lines of the computer at the right time.
