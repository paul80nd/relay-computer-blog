title: "Auxiliary Control"
---

This card incorporates the primary input switches at the front of the computer and allows for a program to be loaded into
[memory]({{< relref "/cards/memory" >}}) (and confirmed) line-by-line. The 8-bit switches are set for each instruction and
then deposited into memory. 

The card also contains a limited clock, sequencer and controller to operate the appropriate control lines and move the 
program counter on as necessary.
