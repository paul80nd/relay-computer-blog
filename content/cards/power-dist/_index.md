title: "Power Distribution"

The Power Distribution is a small card that takes the incoming power supply and splits it between the
[W, X, Y and Z backplanes]({{< relref "/cards/backplane" >}}) and the front panel operations. Each power line has a 2A fuse to protect it in case of a short circuit or similar.
