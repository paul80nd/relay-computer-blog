title: "Backplane"

Not a single card but actually one of four ... and technically not a card at all but they are card shaped. These are the 'cards'
that connect a group of five cards together in each card bay (W, X, Y and Z). Each carries a selection of lines and busses to
the cards it holds and also hosts connections to the ribbon cables taking the busses and control lines of to other backplane
cards and areas of the computer.
