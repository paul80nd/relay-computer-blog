title: "Register J"
---

The J Register is one of the [specialised registers]({{< relref "/pages/registers">}}) within the relay computer. It can hold two 8-bit values (J1 and J2) and can read (but not write) from the data bus. Additionally it can also write (but not read) a 16-bit value to the address bus combining the J1 and J2 8-bit registers together. Typically it is used to store the address for
a jump on the GOTO instruction.
