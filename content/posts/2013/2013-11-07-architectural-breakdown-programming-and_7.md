So, the last post didn't quite wrap up this 'mini-series' but hopefully this 
one will. Continuing on with how the Programming and Control of the computer 
happens here again, for the last time (really last time), is the architecture 
I'll be building against (from the 
[Harry Porter Relay Computer](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/Relay/index.html))

In the last post I covered an example of the 
steps required to subtract 6 from 10 (with 6 placed in register B and 10 in 
register C beforehand) and also that each step is represented by an opcode 
which is placed in the Instruction register so the computer can work out the 
sequence of actions to take to perform the step. The collection of program 
steps are stored in the memory along with any data required and so a full 
program to subtract 6 from 10 would look as follows in memory:

    0001  11000000    Set M-Register to 0x0016
    0002  00000000
    0003  00010110  
    0004  10010010    Load Register C from Memory (Address in M)
    0005  11000000    Set M-Register to 0x0017
    0006  00000000
    0007  00010111  
    0008  10010001    Load Register B from Memory (Address in M)
    0009  10000110    ALU Not to A
    000A  00000001    Move A to B
    000B  10000010    ALU Increment to A
    000C  00000001    Move A to B
    000D  10000001    ALU Add to A
    000E  11000000    Set M-Register to 0x0018
    000F  00000000
    0010  00011000
    0011  10011000    Store Register A into Memory (Address in M)
    0012  10101110    HALT
    0013  00000000
    0014  00000000
    0015  00000000    Data Starts Below
    0016  00001010    10
    0017  00000110    6
    0018  00000000    0 (Result will be stored here)
 
First thing to 
note is the values in the left column are the memory addresses (shown in 
hexadecimal) â€” you can see that this increases by one for each sequential byte 
in the program. The second column is the opcode itself and there's a couple of 
new opcodes thrown in here. Firstly the 'Load 16-bit immediate' which places a 
16-bit value into the M register by loading the first byte that follows the 
opcode into M2 then the next byte into M1. There is also the Load and Store 
opcodes which using the address stored in the M register either store a value 
from a given register to memory or load a register with a value in memory. 
Finally there is the Halt opcode which stops the computer from executing the 
program. Notice again that the data and program both sit in memory and the 
values 10 and 6 are stored following the program.

So, how does the 
program get in memory in the first place? Effectively you would set the target 
address for the first line of the program on the address bus, enter the opcode 
on the data bus then load the value into memory (all by using toggle 
switches). Next you set the target address one slot higher, set the next 
opcode and load the value into memory. This sequence is repeated until the 
program is all loaded in. Needless to say if you get a power cut then you'll 
have to start again from scratch. Incidentally the 
[Phil Ryals RC-3 Relay Computer](http://www.computerculture.org/projects/rc3/) 
makes this all a little bit easier by letting the user 
set the opcode and then flick a single switch which stores the value in memory 
and increments the address by one.

With the program in memory we're 
all set to let the computer start executing it. We just need to ensure the 
Program Counter register is pointing at the first line of the program 
(typically at address 0) and we're good to go. Starting the computer up it 
will now perform the following steps:

1. Read the value in Memory (at the address pointed to by the Program Counter) 
into the Instruction Register.
2. Increment the Program Counter by 1 (using the 16-bit incrementer)
3. Decode the Instruction Register and perform the operation
4. Repeat

This allows a sequential program (like the 
subtract one above) to run through to the end as intended. If we want to do 
something a little more complex that's where jumps come in so that depending 
on the result of the ALU condition registers we can jump to a different line 
of the program by setting the Program Counter to an address pre-loaded into 
the J register. That's basically it ... in the next post I'll reveal the full 
list of opcodes this computer will implement along with the assembly mnemonics 
for each although I won't go into too much detail on it for now as it'll be 
quite a while before the computer is at the stage where its ready to be 
programmed.
