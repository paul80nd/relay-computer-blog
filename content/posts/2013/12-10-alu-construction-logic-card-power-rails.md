It seems that every time I move on to the next stage of construction on the 
ALU logic card it's fiddlier than the stage before it ... this stage is no 
exception. This time I'm adding the power and ground rails that run around the 
solder side of the board. I'll start with a picture of how it looks:

The 
really, really, fiddly bit this time is cutting all those lengths of (solid 
single core) wire to the required length and then stripping the insulator, 
bending the ends and soldering down — nothing complex ... just fiddly. As part 
of adding these rails I've laid down some additional header pins up the middle 
of the board to get power to the relay gates as needed. Following usual 
convention the 12V power rails are in red and the ground rails are in 
black.

That pretty much wraps it up for the soldering work on this 
board. I've given the board a quick initial clean with some PCB cleaner to 
remove all the rosin residue (embarrassingly enough I'm not sure if the solder 
I'm using is no-clean or not so I'm cleaning it just in case — I will ask my 
supplier [BitsBox](http://www.bitsbox.co.uk/) at 
some point to find out for sure). It's now time to make a start on the wire 
wrapping so my next post will be about that.
