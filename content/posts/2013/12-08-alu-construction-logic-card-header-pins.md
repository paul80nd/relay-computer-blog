Following on from the successful construction of the first bit on the ALU 
logic card in my last post it's now time to start putting together the other 7 
bits and the gating circuits (to place one of the logic results on to the data 
bus). First up is soldering down all the header pins that I'll wire wrap 
to.

This part of the construction is certainly repetitive and it's 
easy to make mistakes ... and actually I made a couple within placing down the 
first few headers. Suffice to say that it's a lot easier to solder multi-leg 
components than it is to unsolder them. Here's the result of this evenings 
work:

The board is 
starting to take shape now ... the next job will be soldering down all the 
sockets for the relays which promises to be an incredibly fiddly job.
