I'm now just one session of wire wrapping away from a completed ALU logic 
card. The final job is to wire up the gating relays that select one of the 
five logic results back on to the data bus. Nothing too difficult ... just a 
case of routing the wires in the best way possible to keep things neat and out 
of the way of the relay sockets.

{% endfigure %}

Keeping 
with the same wiring colour convention as before the green wires are the 
results heading out to the data bus, the blue wires are the inputs B and C and 
the yellow wires are the control lines which activate each of the gating 
relays as required.

That's the logic card pretty much done ... just 
need to pop in the final relays and give everything a test.
