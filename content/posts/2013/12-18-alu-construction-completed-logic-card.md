The ALU logic card is now finally complete! ... well, it is now I've popped 
the last few relays into their sockets. The final card looks like this:

{% endfigure %}

As the old 
saying goes: a picture paints a thousand words ... I'm not sure therefore how 
many words a video paints but it definitely seems the best way to demonstrate 
the card in operation. So, with that in mind, I've (painstakingly) put the 
following YouTube video together which gives a walkthrough of the ALU logic 
card in operation. This one also breaks tradition with my previous videos, 
where the only sound is the relays clicking, and has a narrative track added 
courtesy of my very own 'dulcet' tones.

As you can well imagine I'm pretty pleased that everything is working as 
intended but this is just the beginning ... there's still two other cards 
needed (the Arithmetic and Control cards) to form the full ALU and then 
there's all those registers let alone all the control and timing circuitry 
coming up ... but, for now, I can sit back for a short while and bask in the 
contented feeling of making something that works.

Regular readers 
of my blog may know that I've been playing catch up and construction has been 
quite a way ahead of my posts. Well, I've now caught up so from now on the 
posts will be pretty much following the pace of construction. In real terms 
this means I'll be posting less often (the construction of this computer is 
very much a part time hobby) but on the plus side it'll probably means I'll be 
more consistent in my writing in terms of past, current and post tense.

This'll be my last post now for 2013 ... I really, really should get 
around to wrapping some Christmas presents rather than spending all my time 
soldering things followed by writing about soldering things.  Happy holidays / 
new year / etc ;)
