Continuing on with the wire wrapping for the ALU logic card next up is the 
input and result links:

{% endfigure %}

Given the limited range of colours I've got to choose from (Black, 
Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) I've chosen the following scheme for the wire 
links:

* Black: Internal wire links
* Red: Power links
* Blue: Input links
* Green: Result links
* Yellow: Control links

I'll no doubt break this convention at some point 
but in general it should make the cards a little bit easier to fathom out at 
first glance ... especially as the number of wires on the board increases.

Technically there's now enough wire linked in to actually spark up the 
card and see the results on the LEDs along the card front ... and it's too 
much of a temptation for me not to so I'm going to plug in some relays and 
give it a whirl.
