In the last post I promised to reveal the planned instruction set for the 
computer and [here it is](/pdf/instruction-set.pdf) (pdf file).

This should be viewed alongside the architecture diagram which 
can be found in my previous architecture posts ... and to be fair if you've 
been following along through my recent posts then just close your eyes ... 
you'll probably find it's been burnt on to your eye balls given the amount of 
times I've posted it ;)

I'll avoid going into depth 
on the instruction set for now but suffice to say it's based on the 
instruction set used by the [Dr Harry Porter Relay Computer](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/Relay/index.html) 
so it all works with the architecture it was 
designed for (the same architecture I'm building against).

So, it's now time to move on from the architecture and theory 
side of things (which is all looking sound) and start thinking about how to 
actually construct the computer. For now though I've got a nice long weekend 
away :)
