Before I can test all of the LEDs laid down 
so far (to make sure they survived the heat of the soldering iron) I need to 
add some wire links on the logic card between the LED anodes and the header 
pins. This isn't needed on the arithmetic and control cards as they only have 
a single row of LEDs and so are soldered directly to the header pins but on 
the logic card, which has two rows of LEDs, the 'negative rail' sits between 
the LED anodes and header pins.

To make the wire links I'm using 
the same 30AWG Kynar wire I'll be using later for wire wrapping. This is a bit 
fiddly due to the size of the wire but not bad once you get the hang of it. 
With the links in place the logic card now looks like this:

I've also 
tidied up some of the uglier solder joints whilst the 'iron was hot' (although 
the results still won't win any beauty contests).

I should now be 
able to test the LEDs (fingers crossed) ... I'll take some videos of the 
results and post them up next.
