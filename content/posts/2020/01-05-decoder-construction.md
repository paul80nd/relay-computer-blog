In my last post I covered off the full design for the decoder card so all that remains is to get it soldered up and
tested. As before I've put a video together which covers the highlights:

As you can see towards the end of the video that's the basics of branching complete and finally my computer is capable of
running more complicated programs that have loops and decision making points in them. As reaching this point has coincided
nicely with the start of a new decade I'll now pause construction for a moment whilst I create a series of '2020 update'
videos. In these videos I'll cover off:

- Architecture
- Instruction Set
- Assembly Language
- Programming
- Computer Tour
- Computer Demo

Keep an eye out on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/paul80nd) for the videos being published throughout
January 2020. I'll also update this blog of course with links to the video plus any supporting docs etc. Happy new year one
and all.
