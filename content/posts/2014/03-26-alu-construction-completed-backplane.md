In my last post I mentioned I'd suffered a bit of a set back with the 
construction of the ALU backplane. Well, the short version of things is that 
I've admitted defeat and constructed a new backplane using a different design 
... it looks like this:

{{< fig >}}

This design uses 
stackable headers instead of regular sockets so that the pins extend out of 
the back of the card far enough to attach an IDC connector. Each of these 
connectors can then be 'daisy chained' together with ribbon cable making 
construction relatively quick and easy to do.

So, what went wrong 
with the original backplane? Well, it was one of those cases where it worked 
fine on paper and in my head but not quite so in reality. This is where the 
original card ended up:

In this 
design the regular sockets have header pins soldered alongside on the back of 
the card. The idea was that I could then take a length of wire and wrap it 
around each post soldering as I go. It dawned on me, as I made a start on the 
wiring, that this was going to be an incredibly fiddly job (mainly down to 
faffing around with the wire insulation to keep the nearby bare wires from 
shorting) but I carried on undeterred. It was after soldering a couple more 
connections when physics took over and reminded me who's the boss ... the 
problem being is that the more connections are soldered to the wire the more 
metal there is to wick away the heat of the soldering iron. Eventually there's 
so much metal to heat that the soldering iron gives up trying and it's no 
longer possible to melt the solder.

I considered some ways of 
salvaging the backplane but in the end decided the quickest and easiest route 
was to start a new backplane with a new design that circumvented all that 
soldering. Here's a close up picture of the new backplane:

The power 
connectors are simply connected with soldered wire links but everything else 
is connected with ribbon cable. These were reasonably simple to construct ... 
the main thing to watch out for was getting the spacing between the connectors 
right. Here's another close up from the other end of the card.

There's a 
slight oddity down this end which is due to another design anomaly. The 
backplane is designed to take a set of bus lines in at the bottom of the card 
and send the same bus lines out at the top. For regular straight boxed headers 
this isn't a problem â€” if pin 1 is on the bottom left at the bottom of the 
card then it'll be on the bottom left at the top of the card. However, this 
card uses right angled boxed headers to cram more in on the card but this has 
the effect of flipping the lines vertically so whereas pin 1 is on the bottom 
left at the bottom of the card it'll come out on the top left at the top of 
the card. The fix for this is to twist each pair of wires on the ribbon cable 
to counter this effect and that's what can be seen in the photo above.

I may still try and find a way of finishing the old backplane rather 
than throw it away but I'll leave that for another day. In the meanwhile 
though I've ended up with a working backplane which means I'm now finally in a 
position to connect all three ALU cards together and test everything working 
together.
