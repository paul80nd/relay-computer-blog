I've managed to squeeze in a couple more wire wrapping sessions this week so 
in this post there's a few photos of progress so far.

Inputs B and 
C are fully wired in now as is the data bus output. As all the wiring is now 
complete on the arithmetic 1-bit units I've popped the relays in.

The next wire links to add are the control lines which 
select either the Add or Increment operation and then once that's done the 
card should be ready for powering up and testing/debugging.
