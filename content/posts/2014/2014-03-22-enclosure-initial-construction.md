I've been promising this post for quite a while now ... an update on 
how the enclosure construction is going. Well, it's very good thanks :)

Firstly, here's a quick reminder of the SketchUp design showing how 
the enclosure should look:

{% figure %}![Enclosure Design in SketchUp](/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-03-22-0000.png){% endfigure %}

... and 
here's how it looks, so far, in reality ...

{% figure %}![Enclosure Frame](/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-03-22-0001.JPG){% endfigure %}

This is the main frame 
of the card enclosure and you can see it forms four compartments that will 
hold five cards each plus backplanes. At the moment the front and back doors 
are incomplete as they're waiting for the perspex/acrylic sheet (3mm smoked 
transparent) to be cut. Likewise the perspex that fits in the sides of the 
main frame are also pending. Because of this the frame as it appears above 
isn't fully screwed together yet ... the back bars (which kind of form a shape 
like two 'E's back to back) are just held in by friction on the corners. Once 
the side perspex panels are in then everything can be screwed together and a 
very rigid strong frame results. All the joints are held together with self 
tapping torx screws which are driven into the end of a piece of profile and 
then the screw head rests in the slot of a second piece of profile and is 
tightened with a screw driver via a drilled access hole.

I'm 
particularly pleased with the finish of the aluminium profile I've used for 
the enclosure — it's really high quality and strong yet relatively easy to 
machine and work with. In putting this together I've had to learn some metal 
working skills ... like how to drill metal without breaking the drill (or my 
hands) ... but effectively it's all relatively straightforward stuff. One 
thing I've definitely learnt is to use WD40 for everything, especially when 
driving the self tapping screws in ... it took a couple of days for my hands 
to stop throbbing after trying to drive the screws in without lubrication.

Here's some more pictures of the frame:

{% endfigure %}

One 
thing you might be able to see on the pictures above is the black insert that 
runs inside the left and right side edges. This is a snap-in plastic mounting 
rim which will hold the perspex panel in place. A nice feature of this plastic 
rim is it's reversible so you can rotate it 180 degrees and use it as a 
blanking strip. This keeps dust and muck out of the exposed profile slot and 
also hides the access holes drilled to tighten the connecting screws. You can 
see the strip used in this way in the pictures above running vertically on the 
corner profiles.

For the enclosure doors four pieces of rounded 
profile are joined together using corner brackets which looks like this:

![Door Frame (corner close up)](/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-03-22-0006.JPG)
{% endfigure %}

The door 
hasn't been fully screwed together yet as it's also waiting for the perspex 
sheet which will sit inside this frame and as with the main enclosure frame 
the plastic mounting rims are installed in the profiles for carrying the 
perspex sheet when installed. One thing I will say about these doors is that 
they represent the most expensive part of the enclosure and it's mainly down 
to those corner brackets ... they come in at around £3.75 each which is fine 
until you realise you need eight of them (four per door) and then the caps 
which cover the brackets come in around £1.30 a corner. In hindsight I could 
have gone with a non-rounded door as a cheaper option but the choice I've 
ended up going for does look much nicer and I guess you have to pay for that 
;) Incidentally, metal profile in general isn't a particularly cheap method of 
construction ... the enclosure as you see above has come to around £145 
(although 20% of that goes to the government of course in VAT). Oh, and 
actually £24 of that is on 70 T4 nuts which sit in the profile slots so I can 
attach the various card supports and so on.

So yea, quite a lot of 
money to spend on an enclosure but even though it's not quite finished yet I 
personally think it looks really good. Here's some more pictures to hopefully 
get across its good looks   (this time with a corner cap installed on the door 
brackets):

I keep mentioning the perspex that I'll need to complete the 
enclosure ... this might take a little bit of time to arrive ... mainly 
because I've not ordered it yet ... I'm waiting for a free delivery offer from 
the laser cut company (which they do from time to time) as otherwise it's a 
fairly hefty charge. It might seem odd using laser cut for what should 
effectively be a rectangular piece of perspex, and it's true just buying 
straight cut perspex sheet is definitely cheaper, but the doors require a bit 
of an odd cut due to the corner brackets blocking out the corners. As such I 
actually need a perspex sheet that has corners cut like this:

{% figure %}
![Door Perspex Cutting Line](/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-03-22-0009.png)
{% endfigure %}

This forms the 'tabs' that will sit 
in the plastic mounting rim but allows for the corner bracket which takes an 
additional 3mm up due to some locating lugs which help keep the bracket 
positively lined up with the profile edge. The easiest and cleanest way to 
achieve the shape above is with laser cut - I simply upload a file detailing 
the shape to cut and several days later the cut perspex arrives in the post. 
There's also another reason for getting the perspex via the laser cut route 
... I have something else I want cutting too ... each of the four card bays in 
the enclosure needs a floor and ceiling that will carry the card guides. 
Here's a SketchUp drawing showing the floor and ceiling in place:

{% figure %}![Card Bay Floor/Ceiling](/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-03-22-0010.png){% endfigure %}

Although the 
floor/ceilings are pictured here as a simple board the real thing will need to 
be cut around the aluminium profile, have holes drilled for fixing to the 
profile and to fit the card guides, have slots to feed ribbon cable though and 
finally have ventilation slots. These floor/ceiling boards will be made from 
3mm thick plywood and these are definitely easier to get laser cut given what 
a pain it'd be to hand cut eight of these. Here is the laser cut lines:

{% figure %}![Floor/Ceiling Board Cut Lines](/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-03-22-0011.png){% endfigure %}

The four 
holes in the corners are for bolting the board to the aluminium profile with 
the remaining holes taking the card guides. At the top is a slot for passing 
ribbon cables though and the diagonal slots are for ventilation. As mentioned 
there are eight of these boards in total, all identical, and so the full cut 
file is as follows:

{% figure caption:"Floor/Ceiling Full Cut Lines ([larger](/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-03-22-1000.png))" %}![Floor/Ceiling Full Cut Lines](/assets/img/posts/2014/2014-03-22-0012.png){% endfigure %}

The orange 
outline here defines the cuttable area from the preset sheet size. One thing 
worth noting on the cut images above is that I've thickened the lines up so 
they're easier to see here — for cutting the lines need to be set at 0.01mm 
(plenty thick enough for a laser beam).

Right, that's enough for 
this post (I've gone on far too long). I'll post on the enclosure again when 
the perspex and floor/ceiling boards are in. For now I'm back working on the 
backplane for the ALU cards and I've suffered a bit of a set back due to some 
poor design decisions that's meant I've had to throw the whole backplane card 
away and start on a new one with a different design. Needless to say I'll 
reveal the whole sorry tale in an upcoming post.
