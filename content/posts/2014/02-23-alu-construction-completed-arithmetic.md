The ALU arithmetic card is now complete! The final card looks like this:

As I did for the ALU logic card before I've put the following 
YouTube video together which gives a walkthrough of the arithmetic card in 
operation ... and as before this one also has a narrative track delivered by 
my own fair gob.

So, that's two out of the three ALU cards done with just the control card 
left to do. Well, I say that ... after the ALU is completed there's all those 
registers let alone all the control and timing circuitry coming up ... I'll 
try not to think too much about the impending work for now.

The 
control card should prove a bit quicker to put together as there's less 
relays, wiring and soldering to contend with. Oo - and for my next post I'll 
share what I've been up to in SketchUp for the enclosure design.
