The B/C Register card is now complete and looks like this:

{% figure %}

![Completed B/C Register Card (back)](/img/posts/2014/2014-05-26-0001.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

As 
usual I've put a video together which demonstrates this card in operation ... 
firstly on its own but then together with all the other cards constructed so 
far. Hopefully these videos are 'adding value' and are worthwhile (they really 
do take ages to put together ... this one took about 5 hours effort in total 
for 20 mins of video). Please do leave any comments, good or bad, either here 
on the blog or on YouTube against the video or feel free to ask any questions 
about the computer as although I know this is a pretty niche subject I can't 
help feeling I'm talking to myself ;)

There's just one more card to go now before the first card bay is full 
... the A/D register card. This will effectively be a duplicate of this card 
but without the B/C ALU feed lines and so should be a little quicker to 
construct. Once complete it should be possible to do some running calculations 
with the ALU by hand and this will take the computer to having an ALU and four 
general purpose registers.

Once the A/D register is complete I'll 
take a small diversion again to construct the first part of the upper 
enclosure ... particularly I'm interested in constructing the switch panel and 
associated control board so that it's much easier to place values on the data 
bus (rather than using the fiddly DIP switches on the bread board). I'm also 
going to start thinking about constructing the display for the computer. As 
always I'll share my thoughts, designs and eventual construction here on this 
blog.
