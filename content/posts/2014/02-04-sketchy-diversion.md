I'm taking a break ... just a short one.

In between all the bouts 
of wire wrapping for the ALU arithmetic card I'm starting to think about 
enclosure options for the computer when it's finally (finally!) finished. I've 
been trawling the internet for inspiration and I'm starting to get a feel for 
the sort of materials and finish I want and I've even been getting some 
prototype laser etching done (more on this in a later post). One thing I'm 
finding as I'm going along though is that I'm trying to picture things in my 
head and there's a lot of guesswork going on. What I need is to employ some 
CAD so I can make sure things fit together before really fitting them 
together.

So, cutting to the chase, after a couple of hours getting 
up to speed with the very usable SketchUp I've created 3D models of all the 
cards I've constructed so far and it looks like this:

{{< fig >}}![3D model of all cards constructed to date](/img/posts/2014/2014-02-04-0000.png){{< /fig >}}

... and with all the boards (virtually) plugged together it looks 
like this ...

This probably doesn't look all that fancy for those gamers out 
there who have become accustomed to slightly more complicated 3D scenes but 
I'm really pleased with it. With this model I can plan the enclosure in 
SketchUp and get everything fitting nicely before getting the credit card out 
and committing for the real thing.

I'll pop up a few posts about 
the enclosure design in the next few months interspersed with the usual 
ongoing ALU construction. It's fair to say I'm quite excited about the 
enclosure (easily pleased) but I'll endeavour to keep the rest of the 
construction going.

Finally, in the spirit of sharing, the SketchUp 
file for the above can be found [here](/skp/computer.skp).
