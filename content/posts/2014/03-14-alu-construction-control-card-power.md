I've been a bit short of time lately so I've been working on the ALU Control 
Card in little bursts ... but after lots of these little bursts I've now got 
all the power rails and wire wrap done for this card.

Here's the 
card as it currently stands:

![ALU Control Card (close up bottom half)](/img/posts/2014/2014-03-14-0002.jpg){{< /fig >}}

... and this is how the power rails look on the solder side of the 
card ...

With the 
rails and wire wrap all done the card just needs the relays popping in and it 
should be ready for a test drive.
