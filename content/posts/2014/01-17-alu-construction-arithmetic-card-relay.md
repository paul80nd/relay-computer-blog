It's always a fiddly job getting the relay sockets soldered in and the ALU 
arithmetic card proved no exception. With this in mind I've been spreading the 
work out over several mini sessions in accordance with my new post-Xmas lack 
of patience. Therefore it's taken me a bit longer than it would otherwise to 
complete this stage of construction although to be fair I also got distracted 
with a [Nixie clock kit](http://www.pvelectronics.co.uk/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=21&amp;products_id=129) my partner bought me for Christmas ... and 
I ran out of solder (this time though I've finally stumped up the cash to buy 
a 500g reel which should keep me going for a good while). Anyho, after much 
procrastination all the sockets (and diodes) are now on.

This time 
around I found that (mercifully) the sockets generally stayed in place whilst 
I soldered them which saved me holding the socket in place with one hand while 
dropping a solder blob to anchor one of the pins with the other hand. It seems 
that if you place the socket correctly first time it'll stay put but if you 
move it around at all then it'll be loose from that point on. With that in 
mind I managed to get maybe 80% or so of the sockets in first time (which 
given there's 123 sockets to place is quite a good thing).

So, on 
with the pictures:

Next 
job for this board is soldering on the power and ground links and after that 
it's wire wrap time. Before that though I'm going to wire up and test the 
adder circuit on a single bit to make sure the design is OK and works in 
reality as expected ... that also means there'll be a video again on my next 
post showing it working (or not perhaps) so that's something to look forward 
to ;)
