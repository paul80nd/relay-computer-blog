Another round of soldering done ... this time putting down the power rails on 
the arithmetic card along with some soldered wire links. This is the last of 
the soldering for this card - it's all wire wrapping form hereon in.

The rear of the card now looks like this:

{{< fig >}}![ALU Arithmetic Card (solder side)](/img/posts/2014/2014-01-26-0000.jpg){{< /fig >}}

The 
power rails are very similar to the ones of the logic card completed earlier 
and they were just as fiddly to complete too ... although, that said, I do 
seem to be developing a bit of a 'sixth sense' for how long a wire should be 
cut without measuring it.

Additional to the power rails are the 
four soldered wire links on each arithmetic bit (totalling 32 links for the 8 
bits in total). These would usually be wire wrapped on the top side of the 
board but are soldered on this side to free up some space for the other wraps 
needed.

Speaking of the top side of the board the only real 
difference from the last post is the additional set of header pins connected 
to the red power rail that will distribute power via wire wraps to where it's 
needed. The top side of the card now looks like this:

So, as mentioned at 
the top of this post, that's the last of the soldering for this card ... just 
a load of wire wrap between here and a completed card.
