I was going to spread 
the fitting of the laser cut parts to the lower enclosure over a couple of 
evenings but in a fit of geeky excitement I ended up doing it all in one 
evening. Fortunately I didn't damage anything in my 'rush' (although I had to 
accept a few niggles) and it went something along this lines of this ...

First job was to fit the panels in to the front and rear door frames. 
As is often the case with these things I had this picture in my head of the 
panels popping straight in the frames with no fuss ... a picture which always 
seems to differ substantially with the real life experience. To say this thing 
was a tight fit is an understatement. I started off with a U shaped frame and 
the idea was to slide the panel in from the top but as the panel moves further 
down it builds up more and more friction resistance in the plastic panel 
holder strips. In the end I took the frame apart and built it back up again 
around the panel but even with this it certainly took some considerable arm 
strength to persuade it to go together.  After much perspiration the panel was 
in and looks like this:

The front door 
(pictured above) ended up as intended but with the matching back door I found 
the panel was a little loose after re-assembling the frame and this seemed to 
be because the panel wasn't quite being gripped by the upper and left hand 
frame inserts. I tried sliding the panel within the frame up and to the left 
to centre the panel within the frame but it'd apparently take more force than 
I could muster so I've left it as is. There's a slight rattle there but 
nothing too bad ... I might take it apart again later and reset the panel but 
I'm not sure how many goes I get on the self tapping screws that hold the 
frame together before I strip the threads.

With a little 'panel 
experience' under my belt I moved on to the side panels for the main enclosure 
itself (aware that getting this one wrong might require quite a bit more 
rework). Fortunately, because these panels are much smaller, they slipped in 
to their frames without too much resistance. With both panels in place I was 
finally able to secure the rear half of the enclosure to the front half. This 
required tightening three screws up a bit at a time until the rear half met 
with the front and secured the panels and everything together. It's a bit of 
an odd design this because it means if I ever need to replace the side panels 
I've got to split the enclosure in half but it's a necessity brought on by my 
wanting to use the curved aluminium profile on the case edges which meant I 
had to be a bit sneaky with where I placed the screws. With the front and rear 
doors fitted the enclosure ends up looking like this:

{% endfigure %}

On the right hand picture you can better see the transparency of 
the smoked acrylic panels with the floor boards showing through. 
Unfortunately, as with the front/rear doors, one of the side panels is a 
little loose in the frame so has a slight rattle when prodded. I'm more 
inclined to leave this one be as taking the enclosure apart to reseat the 
panel would be a thorough pain.

Moving on ... next up is the 
plywood card bay ceiling/floors. I'd already purchased the card guides a while 
back so I just had to dig them out and snap them in to the plywood ... all 40 
of them (5 per board, 2 boards per bay, 4 bays in total). With the card guides 
attached a ceiling and floor board looks like this:

{% figure %}

{% endfigure %}

Somehow, despite following the data sheets for the card 
guides closely, the two holes for the guides aren't quite far enough apart (by 
half a mm or so) so the card guides have a little upward flex in them (around 
1mm). I considered widening the rear hole, which funnily enough is already 
elongated anyway to allow for variation, but decided to leave things as they 
are and the slight flex doesn't appear to cause any problems.

Before fitting the floor/ceilings to the enclosure I needed to address a 
small design issue. Actually, unlike other gaffs I've made in the design, this 
was one I was aware of from the beginning and had already accepted a work 
around. The problem is that the card guides stand proud of the board underside 
when fitted so that they would foul the aluminium profile they're fitted 
against ... here's a picture that shows the problem:

Still, nothing the (sloppy) application of a Dremel can't sort out 
(with the sanding drum attached) ...

With that little issue sorted I could finally fit the eight boards 
to the enclosure. This was done using M4 screws and the special/magic bolts 
designed for use with the aluminium profile. These special bolts slot in 
sideways in the profile grove and then as you begin to tighten them with the 
screw they rotate 90 degrees thereby locking in to place. Here's a close up of 
a ceiling and floor attached in one of the card bays (you can also see one of 
the bolts mentioned above in the top right of the picture - here it's acting 
as something the magnet in the doors can latch on to (the aluminium itself is 
not magnetic of course)):

Incidentally, to get the alignment right I 
secured the floor board as central as possible and then loosely attached the 
ceiling, inserted some cards and then adjusted and tightened the ceiling 
screws once everything looked lined up.

So, that's all of the lower 
enclosure laser cut parts fitted. Here's a couple of pictures with all 
floors/ceiling boards in place ... first from the rear and then from the front 
(with rear door fitted):

{% endfigure %}

There's not too much to do on the lower enclosure now ... I do 
need some way of attaching the card backplane(s) in place and I've got 
Meccanno in mind. I've found a website that sells individual Meccanno 'spare' 
parts so should be able to use them to form a bracket that will be sturdy 
enough to take the force of cards being inserted in to a backplane. Other than 
that I just need to run some ribbon cable around the place but I'll do that as 
I go along. At some point (when I'm feeling flush with cash) I'll finish off 
the upper enclosure design and get the aluminium profile and laser cut panels 
ordered but meanwhile it's time to get back to the construction of the 
computer itself and the lower enclosure will now be able to hold all of the 
cards I've got planned.
