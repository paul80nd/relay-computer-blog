I've been looking forward to this moment for nearly a month ... the laser cut 
parts I ordered to move my enclosure construction forward have finally 
arrived.

{% figure %}

{% endfigure %}

The picture on the left is viewing the part from the top side and 
the one on the right from the underside. The part was cut with the top side 
facing up and so the bottom side has picked up plenty of burn marks which is 
reasonably inevitable when cutting plywood with a laser. The odd hexagon 
shaped burns on the underside come from, I think, the cutting bed which has a 
lattice structure with this shape. All of these burn marks can be carefully 
sanded away but I actually quite like them ... a mark of its provenance if you 
like.

There's eight of the card bay floor/ceiling parts so stacked 
in a pile and fanned out they look like this:

That's 
it for the plywood parts ... everything else is made of acrylic. First up on 
the plastic parts are these:

{% figure %}
![Lower enclosure side panels](/img/posts/2014/2014-05-03-0004.JPG)
![Upper enclosure side panels](/img/posts/2014/2014-05-03-0005.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

On the left 
are the panels that fit in the sides of the lower enclosure and on the right 
are their equivalents for what will become the upper enclosure. As mentioned 
in my last 'enclosure post' the upper enclosure isn't fully designed yet but I 
had spare space on the laser cut files so it seemed reasonable to take a 
chance that the design won't change in height at least. Both of these parts 
are made of smoked acrylic so have a certain degree of transparency which 
doesn't show up all that well on the photos above. These parts are both fairly 
simple cuts although one thing that might not be immediately visible is that 
each of the corners is ever so slightly rounded off (to a few mm) to avoid any 
bumps or knocks starting a stress fracture (acrylic can hold high stresses 
around cut lines especially on sharp turns).

In addition to the 
side panels above there are two similar parts which fit the front and back 
doors of the lower enclosure:

As you can no 
doubt see in this photo all the acrylic parts are covered in a lot of dust 
which has also come from the laser cutting process. One side of the acrylic 
has a protective film but the other side doesn't so I have to be quite careful 
when cleaning them as acrylic is quite susceptible to scratching (in addition 
to sharing a certain fragility similar to glass). I've ordered some special 
acrylic cleaning fluid to help me buff out any hairline scratches as you 
should never use normal cleaning products (and certainly not window cleaner 
unless you want the whole panel to permanently fog up).

The door 
panels have some special detailing on the corners that allow them to fit 
around the brackets that hold the door together. Close up they look like 
this:

Finally 
I've got my 'special' panel which will be used on the upper enclosure to house 
the main input switches:

This is probably the most exciting part for me and it put a big 
smile on my face as I saw it for the first time (even though it's from the 
upper enclosure with its unfinished/unstable design so might end up getting 
thrown away). I know it's probably not all that fashionable to be excited by 
laser cut parts but there's a certain something about the finish and feel of 
something that's been cut by a laser. That said, there is a slight problem ... 
in the same way the plywood parts pick up burn marks from the laser on their 
underside the same is true for engraving on acrylic parts on the top side 
(although they get more of a 'smudgy mark'). Here's a close up of the switch 
panel:

You might have to click the picture above and take a look at the 
larger version to see the smudge marks more clearly but it has the effect of 
making the text a bit hazy. This should be no problem to clean up with careful 
use of the acrylic cleaner I've ordered ... I may even chose to infill the 
lettering if it still looks a bit rough afterwards. Fortunately I've got some 
acrylic I ordered quite a while back which was a test piece and features some 
similar engraved lettering which means I can test any cleaning/infilling on a 
throw away piece before doing it for real on the part above.

Right, 
I'm going to stop there for now. Believe it or not it actually take ages to 
write these posts and get all the pictures together (well, it takes me ages at 
least) and it's sunny outside (a relative treat in the UK) so I'm going out to 
enjoy it. I've already fitted all the lower enclosure parts (in a fit of 
excitement in a single evening) but I'll cover how that all went in my next 
post.
