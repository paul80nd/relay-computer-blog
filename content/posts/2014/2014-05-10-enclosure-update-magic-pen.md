Just need to quickly share my experience with what I'm dubbing the 'magic pen' 
before I put up the B/C register schematics (yup, they're finally ready). If 
you've read my recent posts you'll know I ordered in some laser cut acrylic 
parts for my enclosure including one part which is engraved as well as cut for 
the switch panel. Close up it looks like this:

{% endfigure %}

Only problem now is I've got tons of cleaning fluid left and 
a pen mostly full of paint so I'm off now to find things around the house to 
draw on.
